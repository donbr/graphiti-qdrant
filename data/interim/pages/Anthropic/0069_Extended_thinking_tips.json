Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks.\n\nSee [Extended thinking models](/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models) for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking.\n\n## Before diving in\n\nThis guide presumes that you have already decided to use extended thinking mode and have reviewed our basic steps on [how to get started with extended thinking](/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#getting-started-with-extended-thinking-models) as well as our [extended thinking implementation guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).\n\n### Technical considerations for extended thinking\n\n* Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens. We recommend that you start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based on your needs and task complexity.\n* For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that you use [batch processing](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.\n* Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in [any language Claude supports](/en/docs/build-with-claude/multilingual-support).\n* If you need thinking below the minimum budget, we recommend using standard mode, with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML tags (like `<thinking>`). See [chain of thought prompting](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).\n\n## Prompting techniques for extended thinking\n\n### Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions\n\nClaude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model's creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```text User theme={null}\n  Think through this math problem step by step: \n  1. First, identify the variables\n  2. Then, set up the equation\n  3. Next, solve for x\n  ...\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nConsider:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```text User theme={null}\n  Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. \n  Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.\n  Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.\n  ```\n\n  />\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<TryInConsoleButton\n  userPrompt={\n  `Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. \nConsider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.\nTry different methods if your first approach doesn't work.`\n}\n  thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}\n>\n  Try in Console\n</TryInConsoleButton>\n\nThat said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when needed. The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than previous versions. We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then read Claude's thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its thinking from there.\n\n### Multishot prompting with extended thinking\n\n[Multishot prompting](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) works well with extended thinking. When you provide Claude examples of how to think through problems, it will follow similar reasoning patterns within its extended thinking blocks.\n\nYou can include few-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by using XML tags like `<thinking>` or `<scratchpad>` to indicate canonical patterns of extended thinking in those examples.\n\nClaude will generalize the pattern to the formal extended thinking process. However, it's possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best.\n\nExample:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```text User theme={null}\n  I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.\n\n  Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?\n\n  <thinking>\n  To find 15% of 80:\n  1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15\n  2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12\n  </thinking>\n\n  The answer is 12.\n\n  Now solve this one:\n  Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?\n  ```\n\n  />\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<TryInConsoleButton\n  userPrompt={\n  `I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.\n\nProblem 1: What is 15% of 80?\n\n<thinking>\nTo find 15% of 80:\n1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15\n2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12\n</thinking>\n\nThe answer is 12.\n\nNow solve this one:\nProblem 2: What is 35% of 240?`\n}\n  thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}\n>\n  Try in Console\n</TryInConsoleButton>\n\n### Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking\n\nClaude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is enabled. The model typically:\n\n1. Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block\n2. Executes those instructions in the response\n\nTo maximize instruction following:\n\n* Be clear and specific about what you want\n* For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude should work through methodically\n* Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking\n\n### Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior\n\nYou can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claude's logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.\n\nTo make the best use of this methodology, we recommend the following tips:\n\n* We don't recommend passing Claude's extended thinking back in the user text block, as this doesn't improve performance and may actually degrade results.\n* Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block is likely going to degrade results due to model confusion.\n\nWhen extended thinking is turned off, standard `assistant` response text [prefill](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response) is still allowed.\n\n<Note>\n  Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text. If you want a clean response, instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the answer.\n</Note>\n\n### Making the best of long outputs and longform thinking\n\nFor dataset generation use cases, try prompts such as \"Please create an extremely detailed table of...\" for generating comprehensive datasets.\n\nFor use cases such as detailed content generation where you may want to generate longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses, try these tips:\n\n* Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer outputs\n* For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts down to the paragraph level. Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline and maintain the specified word counts\n\n<Warning>\n  We do not recommend that you push Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens' sake. Rather, we encourage you to start with a small thinking budget and increase as needed to find the optimal settings for your use case.\n</Warning>\n\nHere are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Complex STEM problems\">\n    Complex STEM problems require Claude to build mental models, apply specialized knowledge, and work through sequential logical steps—processes that benefit from longer reasoning time.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Standard prompt\">\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```text User theme={null}\n          Write a python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a square,\n          make sure to handle collision detection properly.\n          Make the square slowly rotate.\n          ```\n\n          />\n        </CodeGroup>\n\n        <TryInConsoleButton\n          userPrompt={\n          `Write a python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a square,\nmake sure to handle collision detection properly.\nMake the square slowly rotate.`\n        }\n          thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}\n        >\n          Try in Console\n        </TryInConsoleButton>\n\n        <Note>\n          This simpler task typically results in only about a few seconds of thinking time.\n        </Note>\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title=\"Enhanced prompt\">\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```text User theme={null}\n          Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, \n          making sure to handle collision detection properly. \n          Make the tesseract slowly rotate. \n          Make sure the ball stays within the tesseract.\n          ```\n\n          />\n        </CodeGroup>\n\n        <TryInConsoleButton\n          userPrompt={\n          `Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, \nmaking sure to handle collision detection properly. \nMake the tesseract slowly rotate. \nMake sure the ball stays within the tesseract.`\n        }\n          thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}\n        >\n          Try in Console\n        </TryInConsoleButton>\n\n        <Note>\n          This complex 4D visualization challenge makes the best use of long extended thinking time as Claude works through the mathematical and programming complexity.\n        </Note>\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Constraint optimization problems\">\n    Constraint optimization challenges Claude to satisfy multiple competing requirements simultaneously, which is best accomplished when allowing for long extended thinking time so that the model can methodically address each constraint.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Standard prompt\">\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```text User theme={null}\n          Plan a week-long vacation to Japan.\n          ```\n\n          />\n        </CodeGroup>\n\n        <TryInConsoleButton userPrompt=\"Plan a week-long vacation to Japan.\" thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}>\n          Try in Console\n        </TryInConsoleButton>\n\n        <Note>\n          This open-ended request typically results in only about a few seconds of thinking time.\n        </Note>\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title=\"Enhanced prompt\">\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```text User theme={null}\n          Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with the following constraints:\n          -

Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete\n2. Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result\n3. For coding tasks, ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking\n\nExample:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```text User theme={null}\n  Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. \n  Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:\n  - n=0\n  - n=1\n  - n=5\n  - n=10\n  And fix any issues you find.\n  ```\n\n  />\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<TryInConsoleButton\n  userPrompt={\n  `Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. \nBefore you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:\n- n=0\n- n=1\n- n=5\n- n=10\nAnd fix any issues you find.`\n}\n  thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}\n>\n  Try in Console\n</TryInConsoleButton>\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup>\n  <Card title=\"Extended thinking cookbook\" icon=\"book\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/extended_thinking\">\n    Explore practical examples of extended thinking in our cookbook.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Extended thinking guide\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking\">\n    See complete technical documentation for implementing extended thinking.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
