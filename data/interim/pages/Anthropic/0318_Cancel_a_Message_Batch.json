  "content": "post /v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/cancel\nBatches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.\n\nThe number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.\n\nLearn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)",
