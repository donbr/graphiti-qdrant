The header row should contain the titles \"Name,\" \"Age,\" and \"City.\" The data row should have the values \"John,\" \"25,\" and \"New York.\"                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Example Output\n\nHere's the LaTeX code to create a simple table with three columns and two rows, including a header row with the titles \"Name,\" \"Age,\" and \"City,\" and a data row with the values \"John,\" \"25,\" and \"New York\":\n\n```LaTeX  theme={null}\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nName & Age & City \\\\\n\\hline\nJohn & 25 & New York \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Sample Table}\n\\label{tab:sample}\n\\end{table}\n\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The `table` environment is used to create a floating table that can be positioned automatically by LaTeX.\n* The optional `[h]` parameter suggests to LaTeX to place the table \"here\" in the document flow, if possible.\n* The `\\centering` command centers the table horizontally on the page.\n* The `tabular` environment is used to create the actual table structure.\n* The `{|c|c|c|}` argument specifies three centered columns (`c`) separated by vertical lines (`|`).\n* The `\\hline` command adds horizontal lines to separate the header row from the data rows and to frame the table.\n* The `&` character separates the cells within a row, and `\\\\` marks the end of a row.\n* The `\\caption` command adds a caption to the table, which will be labeled as \"Sample Table\" in this example.\n* The `\\label` command assigns a label to the table, which can be used for cross-referencing within your document.\n\nWhen you compile your LaTeX document, this code will generate a table that looks like this:\n\n```\n+------+-----+----------+\n| Name | Age |   City   |\n+------+-----+----------+\n| John |  25 | New York |\n+------+-----+----------+\n\n```\n\n***\n\n## API Request\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    import anthropic\n\n    client = anthropic.Anthropic(  # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n        api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n    )\n    message = client.messages.create(\n        model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n        max_tokens=2000,\n        temperature=0,\n        system=\"You are an AI assistant with expertise in LaTeX, a document preparation system widely used for academic and technical writing.
