The model maintains consistent relative performance across both widely-spoken and lower-resource languages, making it a reliable choice for multilingual applications.\n\nNote that Claude is capable in many languages beyond those benchmarked below. We encourage testing with any languages relevant to your specific use cases.\n\n## Performance data\n\nBelow are the zero-shot chain-of-thought evaluation scores for Claude models across different languages, shown as a percent relative to English performance (100%):\n\n| Language                          | Claude Opus 4.1<sup>1</sup> | Claude Opus 4<sup>1</sup> | Claude Sonnet 4.5<sup>1</sup> | Claude Sonnet 4<sup>1</sup> | Claude Haiku 4.5<sup>1</sup> | Claude Haiku 3.5 |\n| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| English (baseline, fixed to 100%) | 100%                        | 100%                      | 100%                          | 100%                        | 100%                         | 100%             |\n| Spanish                           | 98.1%                       | 98.0%                     | 98.2%                         | 97.5%                       | 96.4%                        | 94.6%            |\n| Portuguese (Brazil)               | 97.8%                       | 97.3%                     | 97.8%                         | 97.2%                       | 96.1%                        | 94.6%            |\n| Italian                           | 97.7%                       | 97.5%                     | 97.9%                         | 97.3%                       | 96.0%                        | 95.0%            |\n| French                            | 97.9%                       | 97.7%                     | 97.5%                         | 97.1%                       | 95.7%                        | 95.3%            |\n| Indonesian                        | 97.3%                       | 97.2%                     | 97.3%                         | 96.2%                       | 94.2%                        | 91.2%            |\n| German                            | 97.7%                       | 97.1%                     | 97.0%                         | 94.7%                       | 94.3%                        | 92.5%            |\n| Arabic                            | 97.1%                       | 96.9%                     | 97.2%                         | 96.1%                       | 92.5%                        | 84.7%            |\n| Chinese (Simplified)              | 97.1%                       | 96.7%                     | 96.9%                         | 95.9%                       | 94.2%                        | 90.9%            |\n| Korean                            | 96.6%                       | 96.4%                     | 96.7%                         | 95.9%                       | 93.3%                        | 89.1%            |\n| Japanese                          | 96.9%                       | 96.2%                     | 96.8%                         | 95.6%                       | 93.5%                        | 90.8%            |\n| Hindi                             | 96.8%                       | 96.7%                     | 96.7%                         | 95.8%                       | 92.4%                        | 80.1%            |\n| Bengali                           | 95.7%                       | 95.2%                     | 95.4%                         | 94.4%                       | 90.4%                        | 72.9%            |\n| Swahili                           | 89.8%                       | 89.5%                     | 91.1%                         | 87.1%                       | 78.3%                        | 64.7%            |\n| Yoruba                            | 80.3%                       | 78.9%                     | 79.7%                         | 76.4%                       | 52.7%                        | 46.1%            |\n\n<sup>1</sup> With [extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).\n\n<Note>\n  These metrics are based on [MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU) English test sets that were translated into 14 additional languages by professional human translators, as documented in [OpenAI's simple-evals repository](https://github.com/openai/simple-evals/blob/main/multilingual_mmlu_benchmark_results.md). The use of human translators for this evaluation ensures high-quality translations, particularly important for languages with fewer digital resources.\n</Note>\n\n***\n\n## Best practices\n\nWhen working with multilingual content:\n\n1. **Provide clear language context**: While Claude can detect the target language automatically, explicitly stating the desired input/output language improves reliability. For enhanced fluency, you can prompt Claude to use \"idiomatic speech as if it were a native speaker.\"\n2. **Use native scripts**: Submit text in its native script rather than transliteration for optimal results\n3. **Consider cultural context**: Effective communication often requires cultural and regional awareness beyond pure translation\n\nWe also suggest following our general [prompt engineering guidelines](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) to better improve Claude's performance.\n\n***\n\n## Language support considerations\n\n* Claude processes input and generates output in most world languages that use standard Unicode characters\n* Performance varies by language, with particularly strong capabilities in widely-spoken languages\n* Even in languages with fewer digital resources, Claude maintains meaningful capabilities\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Prompt Engineering Guide\" icon=\"pen\" href=\"/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview\">\n    Master the art of prompt crafting to get the most out of Claude.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Prompt Library\" icon=\"books\" href=\"/en/resources/prompt-library\">\n    Find a wide range of pre-crafted prompts for various tasks and industries.
