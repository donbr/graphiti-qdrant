Spaces under management reached 9.2 million\n> * Expanded platform with launch of Matterport Axis motorized mount, Pro3 camera, and major updates to cloud software\n> * Completed acquisitions of Enview (AI for 3D spatial data) and VHT Studios (real estate marketing) to enhance offerings\n> * Signed notable partnerships with Burns & McDonnell and CGS to deliver Matterport's solutions to their enterprise customers\n>\n> Outlook:\n>\n> * Matterport sees a massive market opportunity in digitizing the world's buildings and spaces (estimates \\$240B+ TAM)\n> * Focused on driving adoption with large enterprise customers across key verticals like real estate, AEC, facilities management, and more\n> * Will continue investing in R\\&D and international expansion to penetrate the largely untapped global building market\n> * Near-term growth and margins may be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain issues\n> * However, healthy liquidity position and relatively sticky customer base provide downside protection\n>\n> In summary, Matterport delivered strong top-line growth in 2022 as it made progress penetrating a huge global market. While profitability remains challenged as the company invests heavily for growth, its balance sheet looks solid. Apart from some ongoing supply chain issues, the underlying business momentum appears intact based on key operating metrics. Barring a severe economic downturn, Matterport seems well-positioned to continue gaining share in the nascent building digitization space.\n\n***\n\n## API Request\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    import anthropic\n\n    client = anthropic.Anthropic(\n        # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n        api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n    )\n    message = client.messages.create(\n        model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n        max_tokens=2000,\n        temperature=0,\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": [\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                        \"text\": \"Your task is to analyze the following report:  \\n<report>  \\n[Full text of [Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023](https://investors.matterport.com/node/9501/html), not pasted here for brevity]  \\n</report>  \\n  \\nSummarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways.
