  "content": "<Note>\n  Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).\n</Note>\n\nSometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we've created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.\n\nThe prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the \"blank page problem\" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.\n\n<Tip>Try the prompt generator now directly on the [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard).</Tip>\n\nIf you're interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our [prompt generator Google Colab notebook](https://anthropic.com/metaprompt-notebook/). There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.\n\n<Note>Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an [API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).</Note>\n\n***\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Start prompt engineering\" icon=\"link\" href=\"/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct\">\n    Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Prompt library\" icon=\"link\" href=\"/en/resources/prompt-library/library\">\n    Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"GitHub prompting tutorial\" icon=\"link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial\">\n    An example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Google Sheets prompting tutorial\" icon=\"link\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19jzLgRruG9kjUQNKtCg1ZjdD6l6weA6qRXG5zLIAhC8\">\n    A lighter weight version of our prompt engineering tutorial via an interactive spreadsheet.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
