Stir everything together and enjoy your hot cup of tea.                                                                                      |\n\n### Example output\n\n> 1. Fill a kettle with water and place it on the stove to boil.\n> 2. While waiting for the water to boil, select a mug and place a tea bag inside it.\n> 3. Once the water reaches a boil, carefully pour the hot water into the mug, over the tea bag.\n> 4. Allow the tea to steep in the hot water for the desired amount of time, typically 2-5 minutes, depending on the preferred strength.\n> 5. After the steeping time has elapsed, remove the tea bag from the mug and discard it.\n> 6. Add milk and sugar to the tea, according to your taste preferences.\n> 7. Using a spoon, stir the tea, milk, and sugar together until well combined.\n> 8. Your cup of tea is now ready to enjoy. Drink it while it's still hot.\n\n***\n\n## API Request\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```python Python theme={null}\n  import anthropic\n\n  client = anthropic.Anthropic(\n      # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n      api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n  )\n  message = client.messages.create(\n      model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n      max_tokens=1000,\n      temperature=0,\n      system=\"Your task is to take the provided natural language description of a process or task and transform it into clear, concise step-by-step directions that are logical, sequential, and easy to follow.
