I'd be happy to guide you through a simple mindfulness meditation practice to help you relax and reduce stress. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed, and let's begin.\n\n1. Sit comfortably: Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Keep your back straight but not rigid, and let your hands rest gently on your knees or in your lap.\n2. Focus on your breath: Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest. Try not to control your breath; simply observe it as it is.\n3. Acknowledge wandering thoughts: As you focus on your breath, you may notice thoughts arising in your mind. This is normal and natural. Acknowledge these thoughts without judgment, and gently redirect your attention back to your breath.\n4. Be patient and kind: If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, remember to be patient and kind with yourself. Mindfulness is a practice, and it's okay if your mind wanders. Simply guide your focus back to your breath whenever you notice it has drifted.\n5. Deepen your awareness: As you continue to focus on your breath, allow your awareness to expand to other sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and imagine your breath flowing into those areas, helping them to relax and release.\n6. End the practice: When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you feel. Observe any changes in your mind or body, and carry this sense of calm and awareness with you as you continue your day.\n\nRemember, mindfulness is a skill that develops with practice. Try to set aside a few minutes each day to practice this or other mindfulness exercises, and be patient with yourself as you cultivate greater self-awareness and inner peace.\n\nHow did this meditation practice feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine? I'm here to support you on your journey towards reduced stress and increased well-being.\n\n***\n\n## API request\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    ```Python  theme={null}\n    import anthropic\n\n    client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n    )\n    message = client.messages.create(\n      model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n      max_tokens=1000,\n      temperature=1,\n      system=\"You are an AI assistant with expertise in mindfulness and stress management.
