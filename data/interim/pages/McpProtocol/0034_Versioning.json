  "content": "The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format\n`YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.\n\n<Info>\n  The protocol version will *not* be incremented when the\n  protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows\n  for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.\n</Info>\n\n## Revisions\n\nRevisions may be marked as:\n\n* **Draft**: in-progress specifications, not yet ready for consumption.\n* **Current**: the current protocol version, which is ready for use and may continue to\n  receive backwards compatible changes.\n* **Final**: past, complete specifications that will not be changed.\n\nThe **current** protocol version is [**2025-06-18**](/specification/2025-11-25/).\n\n## Negotiation\n\nVersion negotiation happens during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization). Clients and\nservers **MAY** support multiple protocol versions simultaneously, but they **MUST**\nagree on a single version to use for the session.\n\nThe protocol provides appropriate error handling if version negotiation fails, allowing\nclients to gracefully terminate connections when they cannot find a version compatible\nwith the server.",
