We expect all participants to maintain respectful, professional, and inclusive interactions across all channels.\n\n### Discord\n\nFor real-time contributor discussion and collaboration. The server is designed around **MCP contributors** and is not intended\nto be a place for general MCP support.\n\nThe Discord server will have both public and private channels.\n\n[Join the Discord server here][discord-join].\n\n#### Public Channels (Default)\n\n* **Purpose**: Open community engagement, collaborative development, and transparent project coordination.\n* Primary use cases:\n  * **Public SDK and tooling development**: All development, from ideation to release planning, happens in public channels (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#inspector-dev`).\n  * **[Working and Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups) discussions**\n  * **Community onboarding** and contribution guidance.\n  * **Community feedback** and collaborative brainstorming.\n  * Public **office hours** and **maintainer availability**.\n* Avoid:\n  * MCP user support: participants are expected to read official documentation and start new GitHub Discussions for questions or support.\n  * Service or product marketing: interactions on this Discord are expected to be vendor-neutral and not used for brand-building or sales. Mentions of brands or products are discouraged outside of being used as examples or responses to conversations that start off focused on the specification.\n\n#### Private channels (Exceptions)\n\n* **Purpose**: Confidential coordination and sensitive matters that cannot be discussed publicly. Access will be restricted to designated maintainers.\n* **Strict criteria for private use**:\n  * **Security incidents** (CVEs, protocol vulnerabilities).\n  * **People matters** (maintainer-related discussions, code of conduct policies).\n  * Select channels will be configured to be **read-only**. This can be good for example for maintainer decision making.\n  * Coordination requiring **immediate** or otherwise **focused response** with a limited audience.\n* **Transparency**:\n  * **All technical and governance decisions** affecting the community **must be documented** in GitHub Discussions and/or Issues, and will be labeled with `notes`.\n  * **Some matters related to individual contributors** may remain private when appropriate (e.g., personal circumstances, disciplinary actions, or other sensitive individual matters).\n  * Private channels are to be used as **temporary \"incident rooms,\"** not for routine development.\n\nAny significant discussion on Discord that leads to a potential decision or proposal must be moved to a GitHub Discussion or GitHub Issue to create a persistent, searchable record. Proposals will then be promoted to full-fledged PRs with associated work items (GitHub Issues) as needed.\n\n### GitHub Discussions\n\nFor structured, long-form discussion and debate on project direction, features, improvements, and community topics.\n\nWhen to use:\n\n* Project roadmap planning and milestone discussions\n* Announcements and release communications\n* Community polls and consensus-building processes\n* Feature requests with context and rationale\n  * If a particular repository does not have GitHub Discussions enabled, feel free to open a GitHub Issue instead.\n\n### GitHub Issues\n\nFor bug reports, feature tracking, and actionable development tasks.\n\nWhen to use:\n\n* Bug reports with reproducible steps\n* Documentation improvements with specific scope\n* CI/CD problems and infrastructure issues\n* Release tasks and milestone tracking\n\n**Note**: SEP proposals are submitted as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps), not as GitHub Issues. See the [SEP guidelines](./sep-guidelines) for details.\n\n### Security Issues\n\n**Do not post security issues publicly.** Instead:\n\n1. Use the private security reporting process. For protocol-level security issues, follow the process in [SECURITY.md in the modelcontextprotocol GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n2. Contact lead and/or [core maintainers](./governance#current-core-maintainers) directly.\n3. Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.\n\n## Decision Records\n\nAll MCP decisions are documented and captured in public channels.\n\n* **Technical decisions**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and [SEPs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps).\n* **Specification changes**: [On the Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/changelog).\n* **Process changes**: [Community documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance).\n* **Governance decisions and updates**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and [SEPs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps).\n\nWhen documenting decisions, we will retain as much context as possible:\n\n* Decision makers\n* Background context and motivation\n* Options that were considered\n* Rationale for the chosen approach\n* Implementation steps\n\n[discord-join]: https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX",
