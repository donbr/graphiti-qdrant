Either\nthe client or server can initiate a ping by sending a `ping` request.\n\n## Message Format\n\nA ping request is a standard JSON-RPC request with no parameters:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"method\": \"ping\"\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior Requirements\n\n1. The receiver **MUST** respond promptly with an empty response:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"result\": {}\n}\n```\n\n2. If no response is received within a reasonable timeout period, the sender **MAY**:\n   * Consider the connection stale\n   * Terminate the connection\n   * Attempt reconnection procedures\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\n```mermaid  theme={null}\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Sender\n    participant Receiver\n\n    Sender->>Receiver: ping request\n    Receiver->>Sender: empty response\n```\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n* Implementations **SHOULD** periodically issue pings to detect connection health\n* The frequency of pings **SHOULD** be configurable\n* Timeouts **SHOULD** be appropriate for the network environment\n* Excessive pinging **SHOULD** be avoided to reduce network overhead\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* Timeouts **SHOULD** be treated as connection failures\n* Multiple failed pings **MAY** trigger connection reset\n* Implementations **SHOULD** log ping failures for diagnostics",
