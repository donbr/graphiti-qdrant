Either side can send progress notifications to\nprovide updates about operation status.\n\n## Progress Flow\n\nWhen a party wants to *receive* progress updates for a request, it includes a\n`progressToken` in the request metadata.\n\n* Progress tokens **MUST** be a string or integer value\n* Progress tokens can be chosen by the sender using any means, but **MUST** be unique\n  across all active requests.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"some_method\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"_meta\": {\n      \"progressToken\": \"abc123\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe receiver **MAY** then send progress notifications containing:\n\n* The original progress token\n* The current progress value so far\n* An optional \"total\" value\n* An optional \"message\" value\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/progress\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"progressToken\": \"abc123\",\n    \"progress\": 50,\n    \"total\": 100,\n    \"message\": \"Reticulating splines...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* The `progress` value **MUST** increase with each notification, even if the total is\n  unknown.\n* The `progress` and the `total` values **MAY** be floating point.\n* The `message` field **SHOULD** provide relevant human readable progress information.\n\n## Behavior Requirements\n\n1. Progress notifications **MUST** only reference tokens that:\n   * Were provided in an active request\n   * Are associated with an in-progress operation\n\n2. Receivers of progress requests **MAY**:\n   * Choose not to send any progress notifications\n   * Send notifications at whatever frequency they deem appropriate\n   * Omit the total value if unknown\n\n3. For [task-augmented requests](./tasks), the `progressToken` provided in the original request **MUST** continue to be used for progress notifications throughout the task's lifetime, even after the `CreateTaskResult` has been returned. The progress token remains valid and associated with the task until the task reaches a terminal status.\n   * Progress notifications for tasks **MUST** use the same `progressToken` that was provided in the initial task-augmented request\n   * Progress notifications for tasks **MUST** stop after the task reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`)\n\n```mermaid  theme={null}\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Sender\n    participant Receiver\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Request with progress token\n    Sender->>Receiver: Method request with progressToken\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Progress updates\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.2/1.0)\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.6/1.0)\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (1.0/1.0)\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Operation complete\n    Receiver->>Sender: Method response\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n* Senders and receivers **SHOULD** track active progress tokens\n* Both parties **SHOULD** implement rate limiting to prevent flooding\n* Progress notifications **MUST** stop after completion",
