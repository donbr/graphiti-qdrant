This episode information may still exist within these nodes. If an episode invalidates a fact, and the episode is deleted, the fact will remain marked as invalidated.\n</Note>\n\nWhen you delete an [episode](/graphiti/graphiti/adding-episodes), it will delete all the edges associated with it, and it will delete any nodes that are only attached to that episode. Nodes that are also attached to another episode will not be deleted.\n\nHere's how to delete an episode from a graph:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n  ```python Python\n  from zep_cloud.client import Zep\n\n  client = Zep(\n      api_key=API_KEY,\n  )\n\n  client.graph.episode.delete(uuid_=\"episode_uuid\")\n  ```\n\n  ```typescript TypeScript\n  import { ZepClient } from \"@getzep/zep-cloud\";\n\n  const client = new ZepClient({\n    apiKey: API_KEY,\n  });\n\n  await client.graph.episode.delete(\"episode_uuid\");\n  ```\n\n  ```go Go\n  import (\n      \"context\"\n      \"log\"\n\n      \"github.com/getzep/zep-go/v3/client\"\n      \"github.com/getzep/zep-go/v3/option\"\n  )\n\n  ctx := context.TODO()\n\n  zepClient := client.NewClient(option.WithAPIKey(apiKey))\n\n  _, err := zepClient.Graph.Episode.Delete(ctx, \"episode_uuid\")\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatal(\"Error deleting episode:\", err)\n  }\n  ```\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## Delete a Node\n\nThis feature is coming soon.",
