We believe transparency is important, so here's exactly what we collect and why.\n\n## What We Collect\n\nWhen you initialize a Graphiti instance, we collect:\n\n* **Anonymous identifier**: A randomly generated UUID stored locally in `~/.cache/graphiti/telemetry_anon_id`\n* **System information**: Operating system, Python version, and system architecture\n* **Graphiti version**: The version you're using\n* **Configuration choices**:\n  * LLM provider type (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, etc.)\n  * Database backend (Neo4j, FalkorDB)\n  * Embedder provider (OpenAI, Azure, Voyage, etc.)\n\n## What We Don't Collect\n\nWe are committed to protecting your privacy. We **never** collect:\n\n* Personal information or identifiers\n* API keys or credentials\n* Your actual data, queries, or graph content\n* IP addresses or hostnames\n* File paths or system-specific information\n* Any content from your episodes, nodes, or edges\n\n## Why We Collect This Data\n\nThis information helps us:\n\n* Understand which configurations are most popular to prioritize support and testing\n* Identify which LLM and database providers to focus development efforts on\n* Track adoption patterns to guide our roadmap\n* Ensure compatibility across different Python versions and operating systems\n\nBy sharing this anonymous information, you help us make Graphiti better for everyone in the community.\n\n## View the Telemetry Code\n\nThe Telemetry code [may be found here](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti/blob/main/graphiti_core/telemetry/telemetry.py).\n\n## How to Disable Telemetry\n\nTelemetry is **opt-out** and can be disabled at any time. To disable telemetry collection:\n\n### Option 1: Environment Variable\n\n```bash\nexport GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false\n```\n\n### Option 2: Set in your shell profile\n\n```bash\n### For bash users (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile)\necho 'export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n### For zsh users (~/.zshrc)\necho 'export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n### Option 3: Set for a specific Python session\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED'] = 'false'\n\n### Then initialize Graphiti as usual\nfrom graphiti_core import Graphiti\ngraphiti = Graphiti(...)\n```\n\nTelemetry is automatically disabled during test runs (when `pytest` is detected).\n\n## Technical Details\n\n* Telemetry uses PostHog for anonymous analytics collection\n* All telemetry operations are designed to fail silently - they will never interrupt your application or affect Graphiti functionality\n* The anonymous ID is stored locally and is not tied to any personal information",
