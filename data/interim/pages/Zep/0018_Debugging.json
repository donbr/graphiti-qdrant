Debug logging captures detailed workflow execution logs that can be invaluable for understanding how your data flows through the system.\n\n## Enabling Debug Logging\n\nDebug logging is enabled from the Project Settings page in your Zep dashboard. Once enabled, debug logging will be active for 60 minutes.\n\n> **Important**: Debug logging will be active for the next 60 minutes. During this time, all workflow executions will have detailed logs captured. You can view these logs in the thread logs dialog for any thread that runs during this period.\n\n## Accessing Debug Logs\n\nDebug logs are available from episode lists for both individual users and graph-wide operations.\n\n<Callout intent=\"warn\">\n  **Note**: Debug logs are not supported when adding data or messages in batch operations.\n</Callout>\n\n## Viewing Debug Logs\n\nTo view debug logs for a specific episode:\n\n1. Navigate to the episode list (either from a user or graph view)\n2. Find the episode you want to debug\n3. Click on the **Actions** menu for that episode\n4. Select **Debug Logs**\n\nThis will open a detailed view of the workflow execution logs for that specific episode, showing you:\n\n* Step-by-step execution flow\n* Processing timestamps\n* Error messages and stack traces\n* Performance metrics\n* Data transformation details\n\n## Best Practices for Debug Logging\n\n* **Enable selectively**: Only enable debug logging when actively troubleshooting to avoid unnecessary overhead\n* **Time-limited threads**: Debug logging automatically disables after 60 minutes to prevent performance impact\n* **Review promptly**: Review debug logs within 24 hours. Stale debug logs are removed after 24 hours.",
