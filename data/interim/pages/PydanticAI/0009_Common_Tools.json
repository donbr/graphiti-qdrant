It is built on top of the [DuckDuckGo API](https://github.com/deedy5/ddgs).\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use duckduckgo_search_tool, you need to install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `duckduckgo` optional group:\n\n```bash\npip install \"pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]\"\n\n```\n\n```bash\nuv add \"pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]\"\n\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the DuckDuckGo search tool with an agent:\n\n[Learn about Gateway](../gateway) duckduckgo_search.py\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool\n\nagent = Agent(\n    'gateway/openai:o3-mini',\n    tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],\n    system_prompt='Search DuckDuckGo for the given query and return the results.',\n)\n\nresult = agent.run_sync(\n    'Can you list the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025?'\n)\nprint(result.output)\n\"\"\"\nI looked into several sources on animated box‐office performance in 2025, and while detailed\nrankings can shift as more money is tallied, multiple independent reports have already\nhighlighted a couple of record‐breaking shows. For example:\n\n• Ne Zha 2 – News outlets (Variety, Wikipedia's \"List of animated feature films of 2025\", and others)\n    have reported that this Chinese title not only became the highest‑grossing animated film of 2025\n    but also broke records as the highest‑grossing non‑English animated film ever. One article noted\n    its run exceeded US$1.7 billion.\n• Inside Out 2 – According to data shared on Statista and in industry news, this Pixar sequel has been\n    on pace to set new records (with some sources even noting it as the highest‑grossing animated film\n    ever, as of January 2025).\n\nBeyond those two, some entertainment trade sites (for example, a Just Jared article titled\n\"Top 10 Highest-Earning Animated Films at the Box Office Revealed\") have begun listing a broader\ntop‑10. Although full consolidated figures can sometimes differ by source and are updated daily during\na box‑office run, many of the industry trackers have begun to single out five films as the biggest\nearners so far in 2025.\n\nUnfortunately, although multiple articles discuss the \"top animated films\" of 2025, there isn't yet a\nsingle, universally accepted list with final numbers that names the complete top five. (Box‑office\nrankings, especially mid‑year, can be fluid as films continue to add to their totals.)\n\nBased on what several sources note so far, the two undisputed leaders are:\n1. Ne Zha 2\n2. Inside Out 2\n\nThe remaining top spots (3–5) are reported by some outlets in their \"Top‑10 Animated Films\"\nlists for 2025 but the titles and order can vary depending on the source and the exact cut‑off\ndate of the data. For the most up‑to‑date and detailed ranking (including the 3rd, 4th, and 5th\nhighest‑grossing films), I recommend checking resources like:\n• Wikipedia's \"List of animated feature films of 2025\" page\n• Box‑office tracking sites (such as Box Office Mojo or The Numbers)\n• Trade articles like the one on Just Jared\n\nTo summarize with what is clear from the current reporting:\n1. Ne Zha 2\n2. Inside Out 2\n3–5. Other animated films (yet to be definitively finalized across all reporting outlets)\n\nIf you're looking for a final, consensus list of the top five, it may be best to wait until\nthe 2025 year‑end box‑office tallies are in or to consult a regularly updated entertainment industry source.\n\nWould you like help finding a current source or additional details on where to look for the complete updated list?\n\"\"\"\n\n```\n\nduckduckgo_search.py\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool\n\nagent = Agent(\n    'openai:o3-mini',\n    tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],\n    system_prompt='Search DuckDuckGo for the given query and return the results.',\n)\n\nresult = agent.run_sync(\n    'Can you list the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025?'\n)\nprint(result.output)\n\"\"\"\nI looked into several sources on animated box‐office performance in 2025, and while detailed\nrankings can shift as more money is tallied, multiple independent reports have already\nhighlighted a couple of record‐breaking shows.
