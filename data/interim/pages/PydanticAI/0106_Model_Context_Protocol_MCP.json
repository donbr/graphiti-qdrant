[Agents](../../agents/) can connect to MCP servers and use their tools using three different methods:\n   1. Pydantic AI can act as an MCP client and connect directly to local and remote MCP servers. [Learn more](../client/) about MCPServer.\n   1. Pydantic AI can use the [FastMCP Client](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client/) to connect to local and remote MCP servers, whether or not they're built using [FastMCP Server](https://gofastmcp.com/servers). [Learn more](../fastmcp-client/) about FastMCPToolset.\n   1. Some model providers can themselves connect to remote MCP servers using a \"built-in tool\". [Learn more](../../builtin-tools/#mcp-server-tool) about MCPServerTool.\n1. Agents can be used within MCP servers. [Learn more](../server/)\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nThe Model Context Protocol is a standardized protocol that allow AI applications (including programmatic agents like Pydantic AI, coding agents like [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and desktop applications like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) to connect to external tools and services using a common interface.\n\nAs with other protocols, the dream of MCP is that a wide range of applications can speak to each other without the need for specific integrations.\n\nThere is a great list of MCP servers at [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).\n\nSome examples of what this means:\n\n- Pydantic AI could use a web search service implemented as an MCP server to implement a deep research agent\n- Cursor could connect to the [Pydantic Logfire](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-mcp) MCP server to search logs, traces and metrics to gain context while fixing a bug\n- Pydantic AI, or any other MCP client could connect to our [Run Python](https://github.com/pydantic/mcp-run-python) MCP server to run arbitrary Python code in a sandboxed environment",
