These modules extend FastMCP's functionality but aren't officially maintained by the core team.\n\nContrib modules provide additional features, integrations, or patterns that complement the core FastMCP library. They offer a way for the community to share useful extensions while keeping the core library focused and maintainable.\n\nThe available modules can be viewed in the [contrib directory](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/tree/main/src/fastmcp/contrib).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use a contrib module, import it from the `fastmcp.contrib` package:\n\n```python  theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\nfrom fastmcp.contrib import my_module\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n* **Stability**: Modules in `contrib` may have different testing requirements or stability guarantees compared to the core library.\n* **Compatibility**: Changes to core FastMCP might break modules in `contrib` without explicit warnings in the main changelog.\n* **Dependencies**: Contrib modules may have additional dependencies not required by the core library. These dependencies are typically documented in the module's README or separate requirements files.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to the `contrib` package! If you have a module that extends FastMCP in a useful way, consider contributing it:\n\n1. Create a new directory in `src/fastmcp/contrib/` for your module\n2. Add proper tests for your module in `tests/contrib/`\n3. Include comprehensive documentation in a README.md file, including usage and examples, as well as any additional dependencies or installation instructions\n4. Submit a pull request\n\nThe ideal contrib module:\n\n* Solves a specific use case or integration need\n* Follows FastMCP coding standards\n* Includes thorough documentation and examples\n* Has comprehensive tests\n* Specifies any additional dependencies",
