  "content": "## Install FastMCP\n\nWe recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FastMCP.\n\nIf you plan to use FastMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:\n\n```bash  theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\nuv add fastmcp\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash uv theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\n  uv pip install fastmcp\n  ```\n\n  ```bash pip theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\n  pip install fastmcp\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nTo verify that FastMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash  theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\nfastmcp version\n```\n\nYou should see output like the following:\n\n```bash  theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\n$ fastmcp version\n\nFastMCP version:                           2.11.3\nMCP version:                               1.12.4\nPython version:                            3.12.2\nPlatform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit\nFastMCP root path:            ~/Developer/fastmcp\n```\n\n### Dependency Licensing\n\n<Info>\n  FastMCP depends on Cyclopts for CLI functionality. Cyclopts v4 includes docutils as a transitive dependency, which has complex licensing that may trigger compliance reviews in some organizations.\n\n  If this is a concern, you can install Cyclopts v5 alpha which removes this dependency:\n\n  ```bash  theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\n  pip install \"cyclopts>=5.0.0a1\"\n  ```\n\n  Alternatively, wait for the stable v5 release. See [this issue](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts/issues/672) for details.\n</Info>\n\n## Upgrading from the Official MCP SDK\n\nUpgrading from the official MCP SDK's FastMCP 1.0 to FastMCP 2.0 is generally straightforward. The core server API is highly compatible, and in many cases, changing your import statement from `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP` will be sufficient.\n\n```python {5} theme={\"theme\":{\"light\":\"snazzy-light\",\"dark\":\"dark-plus\"}}\n# Before\n# from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# After\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"My MCP Server\")\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  Prior to `fastmcp==2.3.0` and `mcp==1.8.0`, the 2.x API always mirrored the official 1.0 API. However, as the projects diverge, this can not be guaranteed. You may see deprecation warnings if you attempt to use 1.0 APIs in FastMCP 2.x. Please refer to this documentation for details on new capabilities.\n</Warning>\n\n## Versioning Policy\n\nFastMCP follows semantic versioning with pragmatic adaptations for the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions (e.g., 2.3.x to 2.4.0) when necessary to stay current with the MCP Protocol.\n\nFor production use, always pin to exact versions:\n\n```\nfastmcp==2.11.0  # Good\nfastmcp>=2.11.0  # Bad - will install breaking changes\n```\n\nSee the full [versioning and release policy](/development/releases#versioning-policy) for details on our public API, deprecation practices, and breaking change philosophy.\n\n## Contributing to FastMCP\n\nInterested in contributing to FastMCP?
