Studio also integrates with [tracing](/langsmith/observability-concepts), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), and [prompt engineering](/langsmith/prompt-engineering).\n\n## Features\n\nKey features of Studio:\n\n* Visualize your graph architecture\n* [Run and interact with your agent](/langsmith/use-studio#run-application)\n* [Manage assistants](/langsmith/use-studio#manage-assistants)\n* [Manage threads](/langsmith/use-studio#manage-threads)\n* [Iterate on prompts](/langsmith/observability-studio)\n* [Run experiments over a dataset](/langsmith/observability-studio#run-experiments-over-a-dataset)\n* Manage [long term memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory)\n* Debug agent state via [time travel](/oss/python/langgraph/use-time-travel)\n\n```mermaid  theme={null}\nflowchart\n    subgraph LangSmith Deployment\n        A[LangGraph CLI] -->|creates| B(Agent Server deployment)\n        B <--> D[Studio]\n        B <--> E[SDKs]\n        B <--> F[RemoteGraph]\n    end\n```\n\nStudio works for graphs that are deployed on [LangSmith](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) or for graphs that are running locally via the [Agent Server](/langsmith/local-server).\n\nStudio supports two modes:\n\n### Graph mode\n\nGraph mode exposes the full feature-set and is useful when you would like as many details about the execution of your agent, including the nodes traversed, intermediate states, and LangSmith integrations (such as adding to datasets and playground).\n\n### Chat mode\n\nChat mode is a simpler UI for iterating on and testing chat-specific agents. It is useful for business users and those who want to test overall agent behavior. Chat mode is only supported for graph's whose state includes or extends [`MessagesState`](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#messagesstate).\n\n## Learn more\n\n* See this guide on how to [get started](/langsmith/quick-start-studio) with Studio.\n\n## Video guide\n\n<iframe className=\"w-full aspect-video rounded-xl\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mi1gSlHwZLM?si=oWCeHQ640zPHoLwn\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen />\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/studio.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
