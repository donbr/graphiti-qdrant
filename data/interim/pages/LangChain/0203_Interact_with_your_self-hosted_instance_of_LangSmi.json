  "content": "This guide will walk you through the process of using your self-hosted instance of LangSmith.\n\n<Info>\n  This guide assumes you have already deployed a self-hosted LangSmith instance. If you have not, please refer to the [kubernetes deployment guide](/langsmith/kubernetes) or the [docker deployment guide](/langsmith/docker).\n</Info>\n\n### Configuring the application you want to use with LangSmith\n\nLangSmith has a single API for interacting with both the hub and the LangSmith backend.\n\n1. Once you have deployed your instance, you can access the LangSmith UI at `http(s)://<host>`.\n2. The LangSmith API will be available at `http(s)://<host>/api/v1`\n3. The LangSmith Control Plane will be available at `http(s)://<host>/api-host`\n\nTo use the API of your instance, you will need to set the following environment variables in your application:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=http://<host>/api/v1\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY=foo # Set to a legitimate API key if using OAuth\n```\n\nYou can also configure these variables directly in the LangSmith SDK client:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport langsmith\nlangsmith_client = langsmith.Client(\n    api_key='<api_key>',\n    api_url='http(s)://<host>/api/v1',\n)\n```\n\nAfter setting the above, you should be able to run your code and see the results in your self-hosted instance. We recommend running through the [*quickstart guide*](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/#quick-start) to get a feel for how to use LangSmith.\n\n### Self-Signed Certificates\n\nIf you are using self-signed certificates for your self-hosted LangSmith instance, this can be problematic as Python comes with its own set of trusted certificates, which may not include your self-signed certificate. To resolve this, you may need to use something like `truststore` to load system certificates into your Python environment.\n\nYou can do this like so:\n\n1. pip install truststore (or similar depending on the package manager you are using)\n\nThen use the following code to load the system certificates:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport truststore\ntruststore.inject_into_ssl()\n# The rest of your code\nimport langsmith\nlangsmith_client = langsmith.Client(\n    api_key='<api_key>',\n    api_url='http(s)://<host>/api/v1',\n)\n```\n\n***\n\n## API reference\n\nTo access the API reference, navigate to `http://<host>/api/docs` in your browser.\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/self-host-usage.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
