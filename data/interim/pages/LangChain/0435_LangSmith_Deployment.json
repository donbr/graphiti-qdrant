  "content": "When you're ready to deploy your LangChain agent to production, LangSmith provides a managed hosting platform designed for agent workloads. Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications, while LangGraph is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution. LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy directly from your repository.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)\n* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)\n\n## Deploy your agent\n\n### 1. Create a repository on GitHub\n\nYour application's code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the [local server setup guide](/oss/python/langchain/studio#setup-local-agent-server). Then, push your code to the repository.\n\n### 2. Deploy to LangSmith\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Navigate to LangSmith Deployments\">\n    Log in to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). In the left sidebar, select **Deployments**.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create new deployment\">\n    Click the **+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Link repository\">\n    If you are a first time user or adding a private repository that has not been previously connected, click the **Add new account** button and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Deploy repository\">\n    Select your application's repository. Click **Submit** to deploy. This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### 3. Test your application in Studio\n\nOnce your application is deployed:\n\n1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.\n2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. Studio will open to display your graph.\n\n### 4. Get the API URL for your deployment\n\n1. In the **Deployment details** view in LangGraph, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.\n2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.\n\n### 5. Test the API\n\nYou can now test the API:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    1. Install LangGraph Python:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    pip install langgraph-sdk\n    ```\n\n    2. Send a message to the agent:\n\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client # or get_client for async\n\n    client = get_sync_client(url=\"your-deployment-url\", api_key=\"your-langsmith-api-key\")\n\n    for chunk in client.runs.stream(\n        None,    # Threadless run\n        \"agent\", # Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.\n        input={\n            \"messages\": [{\n                \"role\": \"human\",\n                \"content\": \"What is LangGraph?\",\n            }],\n        },\n        stream_mode=\"updates\",\n    ):\n        print(f\"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...\")\n        print(chunk.data)\n        print(\"\\n\\n\")\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Rest API\">\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    curl -s --request POST \\\n        --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/runs/stream \\\n        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n        --header \"X-Api-Key: <LANGSMITH API KEY> \\\n        --data \"{\n            \\\"assistant_id\\\": \\\"agent\\\", `# Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.`\n            \\\"input\\\": {\n                \\\"messages\\\": [\n                    {\n                        \\\"role\\\": \\\"human\\\",\n                        \\\"content\\\": \\\"What is LangGraph?\\\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            \\\"stream_mode\\\": \\\"updates\\\"\n        }\"\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Tip>\n  LangSmith offers additional hosting options, including self-hosted and hybrid.
