  "content": "**LangGraph v1 is a stability-focused release for the agent runtime.** It keeps the core graph APIs and execution model unchanged, while refining type safety, docs, and developer ergonomics.\n\nIt's designed to work hand-in-hand with [LangChain v1](/oss/javascript/releases/langchain-v1) (whose `createAgent` is built on LangGraph) so you can start high-level and drop down to granular control when needed.\n\n<CardGroup cols={1}>\n  <Card title=\"Stable core APIs\" icon=\"diagram-project\">\n    Graph primitives (state, nodes, edges) and the execution/runtime model are unchanged, making upgrades straightforward.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Reliability, by default\" icon=\"database\">\n    Durable execution with checkpointing, persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop continues to be first-class.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Seamless with LangChain v1\" icon=\"link\">\n    LangChain's `createAgent` runs on LangGraph. Use LangChain for a fast start; drop to LangGraph for custom orchestration.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\nTo upgrade,\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash npm theme={null}\n  npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash pnpm theme={null}\n  pnpm add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash yarn theme={null}\n  yarn add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash bun theme={null}\n  bun add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nFor a complete list of changes, see the [migration guide](/oss/javascript/migrate/langgraph-v1).\n\n## Deprecation of `createReactAgent`\n\nThe LangGraph `createReactAgent` prebuilt has been deprecated in favor of LangChain's `createAgent`. It provides a simpler interface, and offers greater customization potential through the introduction of middleware.\n\n* For information on the new `createAgent` API, see the [LangChain v1 release notes](/oss/javascript/releases/langchain-v1#createagent).\n* For information on migrating from `createReactAgent` to `createAgent`, see the [LangChain v1 migration guide](/oss/javascript/migrate/langchain-v1#createagent).\n\n## Typed interrupts\n\n[`StateGraph`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/classes/_langchain_langgraph.index.StateGraph.html) now accepts a map of interrupt types in the constructor to more closely constrain the types of interrupts that can be used within a graph.\n\n```typescript expandable theme={null}\nimport { StateGraph, MemorySaver, interrupt } from \"@langchain/langgraph\";\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n\nconst stateSchema = z.object({\n  foo: z.string(),\n})\n\nconst graphConfig = {\n  interrupts: {\n    // Define a simple interrupt that accepts a reason and returns messages\n    simple: interrupt<{ reason: string }, { messages: string[] }>, // [!code highlight]\n    // Define a complex interrupt with the same signature\n    complex: interrupt<{ reason: string }, { messages: string[] }>, // [!code highlight]\n  }\n}\n\nconst checkpointer = new MemorySaver();\n\nconst graph = new StateGraph(stateSchema, graphConfig)\n  .addNode(\"node\", async (state, runtime) => {\n    // Trigger the simple interrupt with a reason\n    const response = runtime.interrupt.simple({ reason: \"test\" });\n    // Return the interrupt response as the new state\n    return { foo: response };\n  })\n  // Compile the graph with the checkpointer\n  .compile({ checkpointer });\n\n// Invoke the graph with initial state\nconst result = await graph.invoke({ foo: \"test\" });\n\n// Access the interrupt data\nif (graph.isInterrupted(result)) {\n  console.log(result.__interrupt__.messages);\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on interrupts, see the [Interrupts](/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts) documentation.\n\n## Frontend SDK enhancements\n\nLangGraph v1 comes with a few enhancements when interacting with a LangGraph application from the frontend.\n\n### Event stream encoding\n\nThe low-level `toLangGraphEventStream` helper has been removed. Streaming responses are now handled natively by the SDK, and you can select the wire format via passing in the `encoding` format to `graph.stream`. This makes switching between SSE and normal JSON responses straightforward without changing UI logic.\n\nSee the [migration guide](/oss/javascript/migrate/langgraph-v1#stream-encoding) for more information.\n\n### Custom transports in `useStream`\n\nThe React `useStream` hook now supports pluggable transports so you can have more control over the network layer without changing UI code.\n\n```typescript  theme={null}\nconst stream = useStream({\n  transport: new FetchStreamTransport({\n    apiUrl: \"http://localhost:2024\",\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nLearn how to integrate and customize the hook: [Integrate LangGraph into your React application](/oss/javascript/langgraph/ui).\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nPlease report any issues discovered with 1.0 on [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs/issues) using the [`'v1'` label](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Av1).\n\n## Additional resources\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"LangGraph 1.0\" icon=\"rocket\" href=\"https://blog.langchain.com/langchain-langchain-1-0-alpha-releases/\">\n    Read the announcement\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Overview\" icon=\"book\" href=\"/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview\" arrow>\n    What LangGraph is and when to use it\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Graph API\" icon=\"diagram-project\" href=\"/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api\" arrow>\n    Build graphs with state, nodes, and edges\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"LangChain Agents\" icon=\"robot\" href=\"/oss/javascript/langchain/agents\" arrow>\n    High-level agents built on LangGraph\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Migration guide\" icon=\"arrow-right-arrow-left\" href=\"/oss/javascript/migrate/langgraph-v1\" arrow>\n    How to migrate to LangGraph v1\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"GitHub\" icon=\"github\" href=\"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs\">\n    Report issues or contribute\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## See also\n\n* [Versioning](/oss/javascript/versioning) – Understanding version numbers\n* [Release policy](/oss/javascript/release-policy) – Detailed release policies\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/javascript/releases/langgraph-v1.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
