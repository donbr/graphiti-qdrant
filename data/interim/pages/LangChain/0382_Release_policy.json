  "content": "This page explains the LangChain and LangGraph release policies. Click on the tabs below to view the release policies for each:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"LangChain\">\n    The LangChain ecosystem is composed of different component packages (e.g., `@langchain/core`, `langchain`, `@langchain/community`, partner packages, etc.)\n\n    ## Release cadence\n\n    With the release of LangChain 1.0, **minor** releases (e.g., from `1.0.x` to `1.1.0`) of `langchain` and `@langchain/core` follow semantic versioning and may be released frequently. Minor releases contain new features and improvements but do not include breaking changes.\n\n    Patch versions are released frequently, up to a few times per week, as they contain bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\n    ## API stability\n\n    The development of LLM applications is a rapidly evolving field, and we are constantly learning from our users and the community. As such, we expect that the APIs in `langchain` and `@langchain/core` will continue to evolve to better serve the needs of our users.\n\n    With LangChain 1.0's adoption of semantic versioning:\n\n    * Breaking changes to the public API will only occur in major version releases (e.g., `2.0.0`)\n    * Minor version bumps (e.g., `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`) add new features without breaking changes\n    * Patch version bumps (e.g., `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`) contain bug fixes and minor improvements\n\n    We will generally try to avoid making unnecessary changes, and will provide a deprecation policy for features that are being removed.\n\n    ### Stability of other packages\n\n    The stability of other packages in the LangChain ecosystem may vary:\n\n    * **Partner packages maintained by LangChain** (such as `langchain-openai` and `langchain-anthropic`) follow semantic versioning and are expected to be stable post 1.0. Other partner packages may follow different stability and versioning policies, and users should refer to the documentation of those packages for more information.\n\n    * **`@langchain/community`** is a community maintained package that contains 3rd party integrations. Due to the nature of community contributions and third-party dependencies, `@langchain/community` does not follow the same strict semantic versioning policy as `langchain` and `@langchain/core`. See the \"Special considerations\" section under Long-term support for more details.\n\n    ## Deprecation policy\n\n    We will generally avoid deprecating features until a better alternative is available.\n\n    With LangChain 1.0's semantic versioning approach, deprecated features will continue to work throughout the entire 1.x release series. Breaking changes, including the removal of deprecated features, will only occur in major version releases (e.g., 2.0).\n\n    When a feature is deprecated in `langchain` or `@langchain/core`, we will:\n\n    * Clearly mark it as deprecated in the code and documentation\n    * Provide migration guidance to the recommended alternative\n    * Provide security updates for the deprecated feature through all 1.x minor releases\n\n    In some situations, we may allow deprecated features to remain in the code base even longer if they are not causing maintenance issues, to further reduce the burden on users.\n\n    ## Long-term support (LTS)\n\n    LangChain follows a long-term support (LTS) policy to provide stability for production applications:\n\n    ### Release status definitions\n\n    Packages are marked with one of the following statuses:\n\n    * **ACTIVE**: Current active development, includes bug fixes, security patches, and new features\n    * **MAINTENANCE**: Receives all security patches and critical bug fixes, but no new features\n\n    ### Current LTS releases\n\n    **LangChain 1.0** is designated as an LTS release:\n\n    * **Status**: ACTIVE until the release of 2.0\n    * **Support period**: After 2.0 is released, 1.0 will enter MAINTENANCE mode for at least 1 year\n    * **Semver compliance**: Users can upgrade between minor versions (e.g., 1.0 to 1.1) without breaking changes\n\n    ### Legacy version support\n\n    **LangChain 0.3**:\n\n    * **Status**: MAINTENANCE mode\n    * **Support period**: Until December 2026\n    * **Support includes**: Security patches and critical bug fixes\n\n    ### Special considerations\n\n    **@langchain/community 1.0**: Due to the nature of community contributions and third-party integrations, `@langchain/community` may have breaking changes on minor releases.\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"LangGraph\">\n    LangGraph follows a structured release policy to ensure stability and predictability for users building production applications.\n\n    ## Release cadence\n\n    We expect to space out **major** releases by at least 6-12 months to provide stability for production applications.\n\n    **Minor** releases are typically released every 1-2 months with new features and improvements.\n\n    **Patch** releases are released as needed, often weekly, to address bugs and security issues.\n\n    ## API stability\n\n    ### Stable APIs\n\n    All APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features within a major version.\n\n    ### Beta features\n\n    Features marked as `beta` in the documentation are:\n\n    * Feature-complete and tested\n    * Safe for production use with the understanding they may change\n    * Subject to minor API adjustments based on user feedback\n\n    ### Experimental features\n\n    Features marked as `experimental` or `alpha`:\n\n    * Are under active development\n    * May change significantly or be removed\n    * Should be used with caution in production\n\n    ### Internal APIs\n\n    APIs prefixed with underscore (`_`) or explicitly marked as internal:\n\n    * Are not part of the public API\n    * May change without notice\n    * Should not be used directly\n\n    ## Deprecation policy\n\n    When deprecating features:\n\n    1. **Deprecation Notice**: Features are marked as deprecated with clear migration guidance\n    2. **Grace Period**: Deprecated features remain functional for at least one minor version\n    3. **Removal**: Features are removed only in major version releases\n    4. **Migration Support**: We provide migration guides and, when possible, automated tools\n\n    ## Platform compatibility\n\n    ### JavaScript/TypeScript support\n\n    * We support Node.js LTS versions\n    * TypeScript definitions are provided for all public APIs\n    * Browser compatibility is documented for client-side components\n\n    ## Breaking changes\n\n    Breaking changes are only introduced in major versions and include:\n\n    * Removal of deprecated APIs\n    * Changes to required parameters\n    * Changes to default behavior that affect existing applications\n    * Minimum Python/Node.js version updates\n\n    ## Migration support\n\n    For major version upgrades, we provide:\n\n    * Comprehensive migration guides\n    * Automated migration scripts when feasible\n    * Extended support period for the previous major version\n    * Clear documentation of all breaking changes\n\n    ## Long-term support (LTS)\n\n    LangGraph follows a long-term support (LTS) policy to provide stability for production applications:\n\n    ### Release status definitions\n\n    Packages are marked with one of the following statuses:\n\n    * **ACTIVE**: Current active development, includes bug fixes, security patches, and new features\n    * **MAINTENANCE**: Receives all security patches and critical bug fixes, but no new features\n\n    ### Current LTS releases\n\n    **LangGraph 1.0** is designated as an LTS release:\n\n    * **Status**: ACTIVE until the release of 2.0\n    * **Support period**: After 2.0 is released, 1.0 will enter MAINTENANCE mode for at least 1 year\n    * **Semver compliance**: Users can upgrade between minor versions (e.g., 1.0 to 1.1) without breaking changes\n\n    ### Legacy version support\n\n    **LangGraph 0.4**:\n\n    * **Status**: MAINTENANCE mode\n    * **Support period**: Until December 2026\n    * **Support includes**: All security patches and critical bug fixes\n\n    ## See also\n\n    * [Versioning](/oss/javascript/versioning) - Version numbering and support details\n    * [Releases](/oss/javascript/releases) - Version-specific release notes and migration guides\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/release-policy.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
