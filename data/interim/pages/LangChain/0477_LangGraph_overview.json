To view v0.x documentation, [go to the archived content](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/tree/main/docs/docs).\n</Callout>\n\nTrusted by companies shaping the future of agents-- including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more-- LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.\n\nLangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/python/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).\n\nWe will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.\n\nLangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.\n\n## <Icon icon=\"download\" size={20} /> Install\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash pip theme={null}\n  pip install -U langgraph\n  ```\n\n  ```bash uv theme={null}\n  uv add langgraph\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThen, create a simple hello world example:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\n\ndef mock_llm(state: MessagesState):\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"hello world\"}]}\n\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\ngraph.add_node(mock_llm)\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"mock_llm\")\ngraph.add_edge(\"mock_llm\", END)\ngraph = graph.compile()\n\ngraph.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi!\"}]})\n```\n\n## Core benefits\n\nLangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\n\n* [Durable execution](/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\n* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\n* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\n* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.\n* [Production-ready deployment](/langsmith/deployments): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.\n\n## LangGraph ecosystem\n\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:\n\n<Columns cols={1}>\n  <Card title=\"LangSmith\" icon=\"chart-line\" href=\"http://www.langchain.com/langsmith\" arrow cta=\"Learn more\">\n    Trace requests, evaluate outputs, and monitor deployments in one place. Prototype locally with LangGraph, then move to production with integrated observability and evaluation to build more reliable agent systems.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"LangGraph\" icon=\"server\" href=\"/langsmith/agent-server\" arrow cta=\"Learn more\">\n    Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in Studio.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"LangChain\" icon=\"link\" href=\"/oss/python/langchain/overview\" arrow cta=\"Learn more\">\n    Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.\n  </Card>\n</Columns>\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nLangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/langgraph/overview.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
