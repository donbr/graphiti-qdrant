  "content": "## Graphs\n\nAt its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\n\n1. [`State`](#state): A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any data type, but is typically defined using a shared state schema.\n\n2. [`Nodes`](#nodes): Functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current state as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated state.\n\n3. [`Edges`](#edges): Functions that determine which `Node` to execute next based on the current state. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.\n\nBy composing `Nodes` and `Edges`, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the state over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that state.\n\nTo emphasize: `Nodes` and `Edges` are nothing more than functions – they can contain an LLM or just good ol' code.\n\nIn short: *nodes do the work, edges tell what to do next*.\n\nLangGraph's underlying graph algorithm uses [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google's [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pregel-a-system-for-large-scale-graph-processing/) system, the program proceeds in discrete \"super-steps.\"\n\nA super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an `inactive` state. A node becomes `active` when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or \"channels\"). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to `halt` by marking themselves as `inactive`. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are `inactive` and no messages are in transit.\n\n### StateGraph\n\nThe [`StateGraph`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined `State` object.\n\n### Compiling your graph\n\nTo build your graph, you first define the [state](#state), you then add [nodes](#nodes) and [edges](#edges), and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?\n\nCompiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like [checkpointers](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the `.compile` method:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(...)\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  You **MUST** compile your graph before you can use it.\n</Warning>\n\n## State\n\nThe first thing you do when you define a graph is define the `State` of the graph. The `State` consists of the [schema of the graph](#schema) as well as [`reducer` functions](#reducers) which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the `State` will be the input schema to all `Nodes` and `Edges` in the graph, and can be either a `TypedDict` or a `Pydantic` model. All `Nodes` will emit updates to the `State` which are then applied using the specified `reducer` function.\n\n### Schema\n\nThe main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). If you want to provide default values in your state, use a [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). We also support using a Pydantic [`BaseModel`](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that Pydantic is less performant than a `TypedDict` or `dataclass`).\n\nBy default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the [guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#define-input-and-output-schemas) for more information.\n\n#### Multiple schemas\n\nTypically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:\n\n* Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output.\n* We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.\n\nIt is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, `PrivateState`.\n\nIt is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an \"internal\" schema that contains *all* keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define `input` and `output` schemas that are sub-sets of the \"internal\" schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#define-input-and-output-schemas) for more detail.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nclass InputState(TypedDict):\n    user_input: str\n\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\n    graph_output: str\n\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n    user_input: str\n    graph_output: str\n\nclass PrivateState(TypedDict):\n    bar: str\n\ndef node_1(state: InputState) -> OverallState:\n    # Write to OverallState\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"user_input\"] + \" name\"}\n\ndef node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:\n    # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState\n    return {\"bar\": state[\"foo\"] + \" is\"}\n\ndef node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:\n    # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState\n    return {\"graph_output\": state[\"bar\"] + \" Lance\"}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState,input_schema=InputState,output_schema=OutputState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", node_1)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_2\", node_2)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_3\", node_3)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_1\", \"node_2\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_2\", \"node_3\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_3\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\ngraph.invoke({\"user_input\":\"My\"})\n# {'graph_output': 'My name is Lance'}\n```\n\nThere are two subtle and important points to note here:\n\n1. We pass `state: InputState` as the input schema to `node_1`. But, we write out to `foo`, a channel in `OverallState`. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node *can write to any state channel in the graph state.* The graph state is the union of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes `OverallState` and the filters `InputState` and `OutputState`.\n\n2. We initialize the graph with:\n\n   ```python  theme={null}\n   StateGraph(\n       OverallState,\n       input_schema=InputState,\n       output_schema=OutputState\n   )\n   ```\n\n   So, how can we write to `PrivateState` in `node_2`? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the `StateGraph` initialization?\n\n   We can do this because `_nodes` can also declare additional state `channels_` as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the `PrivateState` schema is defined, so we can add `bar` as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.\n\n### Reducers\n\nReducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the `State`. Each key in the `State` has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer:\n\n#### Default Reducer\n\nThese two examples show how to use the default reducer:\n\n```python Example A theme={null}\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: list[str]\n```\n\nIn this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let's assume the input to the graph is:\n\n`{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. Let's then assume the first `Node` returns `{\"foo\": 2}`. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the `Node` does not need to return the whole `State` schema - just an update. After applying this update, the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. If the second node returns `{\"bar\": [\"bye\"]}` then the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]}`\n\n```python Example B theme={null}\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n```\n\nIn this example, we've used the `Annotated` type to specify a reducer function (`operator.add`) for the second key (`bar`). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let's assume the input to the graph is `{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. Let's then assume the first `Node` returns `{\"foo\": 2}`. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the `Node` does not need to return the whole `State` schema - just an update. After applying this update, the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. If the second node returns `{\"bar\": [\"bye\"]}` then the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}`. Notice here that the `bar` key is updated by adding the two lists together.\n\n#### Overwrite\n\n<Tip>\n  In some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the [`Overwrite`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/) type for this purpose. [Learn how to use `Overwrite` here](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#bypass-reducers-with-overwrite).\n</Tip>\n\n### Working with Messages in Graph State\n\n#### Why use messages?\n\nMost modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's [chat model interface](/oss/python/langchain/models) in particular accepts a list of message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as [`HumanMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.HumanMessage) (user input) or [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) (LLM response).\n\nTo read more about what message objects are, please refer to the [Messages conceptual guide](/oss/python/langchain/messages).\n\n#### Using Messages in your Graph\n\nIn many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of `Message` objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see `messages` key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of `Message` objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use `operator.add` as a reducer.\n\nHowever, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use `operator.add`, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.\n\n#### Serialization\n\nIn addition to keeping track of message IDs, the [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain `Message` objects whenever a state update is received on the `messages` channel.\n\nSee more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/serialization/). This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format:\n\n```python  theme={null}\n# this is supported\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"message\")]}\n\n# and this is also supported\n{\"messages\": [{\"type\": \"human\", \"content\": \"message\"}]}\n```\n\nSince the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain `Messages` when using [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages), you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like `state[\"messages\"][-1].content`.\n\nBelow is an example of a graph that uses [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) as its reducer function.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass GraphState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\n```\n\n#### MessagesState\n\nSince having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called `MessagesState` which makes it easy to use messages. `MessagesState` is defined with a single `messages` key which is a list of `AnyMessage` objects and uses the [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\n\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    documents: list[str]\n```\n\n## Nodes\n\nIn LangGraph, nodes are Python functions (either synchronous or asynchronous) that accept the following arguments:\n\n1. `state` – The [state](#state) of the graph\n2. `config` – A [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) object that contains configuration information like `thread_id` and tracing information like `tags`\n3. `runtime` – A `Runtime` object that contains [runtime `context`](#runtime-context) and other information like `store` and `stream_writer`\n\nSimilar to `NetworkX`, you add these nodes to a graph using the [`add_node`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_node) method:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    results: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\ndef plain_node(state: State):\n    return state\n\ndef node_with_runtime(state: State, runtime: Runtime[Context]):\n    print(\"In node: \", runtime.context.user_id)\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state['input']}!\"}\n\ndef node_with_config(state: State, config: RunnableConfig):\n    print(\"In node with thread_id: \", config[\"configurable\"][\"thread_id\"])\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state['input']}!\"}\n\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"plain_node\", plain_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_runtime\", node_with_runtime)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_config\", node_with_config)\n...\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, functions are converted to [`RunnableLambda`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html), which add batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging.\n\nIf you add a node to a graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default name equivalent to the function name.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nbuilder.add_node(my_node)\n# You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `\"my_node\"`\n```\n\n### `START` Node\n\nThe [`START`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/constants/#langgraph.constants.START) Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n```\n\n### `END` Node\n\nThe `END` Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import END\n\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", END)\n```\n\n### Node Caching\n\nLangGraph supports caching of tasks/nodes based on the input to the node. To use caching:\n\n* Specify a cache when compiling a graph (or specifying an entrypoint)\n* Specify a cache policy for nodes. Each cache policy supports:\n  * `key_func` used to generate a cache key based on the input to a node, which defaults to a `hash` of the input with pickle.\n  * `ttl`, the time to live for the cache in seconds. If not specified, the cache will never expire.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport time\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\nfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\n\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    x: int\n    result: int\n\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\n\ndef expensive_node(state: State) -> dict[str, int]:\n    # expensive computation\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return {\"result\": state[\"x\"] * 2}\n\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"expensive_node\", expensive_node, cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=3))\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"expensive_node\")\nbuilder.set_finish_point(\"expensive_node\")\n\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\n\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))    # [!code highlight]\n# [{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}}]\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))    # [!code highlight]\n# [{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}, '__metadata__': {'cached': True}}]\n```\n\n1. First run takes two seconds to run (due to mocked expensive computation).\n2. Second run utilizes cache and returns quickly.\n\n## Edges\n\nEdges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\n\n* Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\n* Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\n* Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\n* Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.\n\nA node can have multiple outgoing edges. If a node has multiple outgoing edges, **all** of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n\n### Normal Edges\n\nIf you **always** want to go from node A to node B, you can use the [`add_edge`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_edge) method directly.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\n```\n\n### Conditional Edges\n\nIf you want to **optionally** route to one or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the [`add_conditional_edges`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_conditional_edges) method. This method accepts the name of a node and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\n```\n\nSimilar to nodes, the `routing_function` accepts the current `state` of the graph and returns a value.\n\nBy default, the return value `routing_function` is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the `routing_function`'s output to the name of the next node.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Use [`Command`](#command) instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.\n</Tip>\n\n### Entry point\n\nThe entry point is the first node(s) that are run when the graph starts. You can use the [`add_edge`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_edge) method from the virtual [`START`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/constants/#langgraph.constants.START) node to the first node to execute to specify where to enter the graph.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n```\n\n### Conditional entry point\n\nA conditional entry point lets you start at different nodes depending on custom logic. You can use [`add_conditional_edges`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_conditional_edges) from the virtual [`START`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/constants/#langgraph.constants.START) node to accomplish this.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function)\n```\n\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the `routing_function`'s output to the name of the next node.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n```\n\n## `Send`\n\nBy default, `Nodes` and `Edges` are defined ahead of time and operate on the same shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of `State` to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with [map-reduce](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#map-reduce-and-the-send-api) design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input `State` to the downstream `Node` should be different (one for each generated object).\n\nTo support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning [`Send`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Send) objects from conditional edges. `Send` takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"subject\": s}) for s in state['subjects']]\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", continue_to_jokes)\n```\n\n## `Command`\n\nIt can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) object from node functions:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        # state update\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        # control flow\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n    )\n```\n\nWith [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to [conditional edges](#conditional-edges)):\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\n        return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n```\n\n<Note>\n  When returning [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. `Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]`. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that `my_node` can navigate to `my_other_node`.\n</Note>\n\nCheck out this [how-to guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#combine-control-flow-and-state-updates-with-command) for an end-to-end example of how to use [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command).\n\n### When should I use Command instead of conditional edges?\n\n* Use [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) when you need to **both** update the graph state **and** route to a different node. For example, when implementing [multi-agent handoffs](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs) where it's important to route to a different agent and pass some information to that agent.\n* Use [conditional edges](#conditional-edges) to route between nodes conditionally without updating the state.\n\n### Navigating to a node in a parent graph\n\nIf you are using [subgraphs](/oss/python/langgraph/use-subgraphs), you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify `graph=Command.PARENT` in [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command):\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"other_subgraph\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\n        graph=Command.PARENT\n    )\n```\n\n<Note>\n  Setting `graph` to `Command.PARENT` will navigate to the closest parent graph.\n\n  When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph [state schemas](#schema), you **must** define a [reducer](#reducers) for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this [example](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#navigate-to-a-node-in-a-parent-graph).\n</Note>\n\nThis is particularly useful when implementing [multi-agent handoffs](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs).\n\nCheck out [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#navigate-to-a-node-in-a-parent-graph) for detail.\n\n### Using inside tools\n\nA common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation.\n\nRefer to [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#use-inside-tools) for detail.\n\n### Human-in-the-loop\n\n[`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using `interrupt()` to collect user input, [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) is then used to supply the input and resume execution via `Command(resume=\"User input\")`. Check out [this conceptual guide](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) for more information.\n\n## Graph migrations\n\nLangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state.\n\n* For threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)\n* For threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\n* For modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys\n* State keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads\n* State keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\n\n## Runtime context\n\nWhen creating a graph, you can specify a `context_schema` for runtime context passed to nodes. This is useful for passing\ninformation to nodes that is not part of the graph state. For example, you might want to pass dependencies such as model name or a database connection.\n\n```python  theme={null}\n@dataclass\nclass ContextSchema:\n    llm_provider: str = \"openai\"\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)\n```\n\nYou can then pass this context into the graph using the `context` parameter of the `invoke` method.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.invoke(inputs, context={\"llm_provider\": \"anthropic\"})\n```\n\nYou can then access and use this context inside a node or conditional edge:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\n\ndef node_a(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):\n    llm = get_llm(runtime.context.llm_provider)\n    # ...\n```\n\nSee [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#add-runtime-configuration) for a full breakdown on configuration.\n\n### Recursion limit\n\nThe recursion limit sets the maximum number of [super-steps](#graphs) the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise `GraphRecursionError`. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to `invoke`/`stream` via the config dictionary. Importantly, `recursion_limit` is a standalone `config` key and should not be passed inside the `configurable` key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\": 5}, context={\"llm\": \"anthropic\"})\n```\n\nRead [this how-to](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#impose-a-recursion-limit) to learn more about how the recursion limit works.\n\n### Accessing and handling the recursion counter\n\nThe current step counter is accessible in `config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]` within any node, allowing for proactive recursion handling before hitting the recursion limit. This enables you to implement graceful degradation strategies within your graph logic.\n\n#### How it works\n\nThe step counter is stored in `config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]`. The recursion limit check follows the logic: `step > stop` where `stop = step + recursion_limit + 1`. When the limit is exceeded, LangGraph raises a `GraphRecursionError`.\n\n#### Accessing the current step counter\n\nYou can access the current step counter within any node to monitor execution progress.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\ndef my_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    current_step = config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]\n    print(f\"Currently on step: {current_step}\")\n    return state\n```\n\n#### Proactive recursion handling\n\nYou can check the step counter and proactively route to a different node before hitting the limit. This allows for graceful degradation within your graph.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\ndef reasoning_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    current_step = config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]\n    recursion_limit = config[\"recursion_limit\"]  # always present, defaults to 25\n\n    # Check if we're approaching the limit (e.g., 80% threshold)\n    if current_step >= recursion_limit * 0.8:\n        return {\n            **state,\n            \"route_to\": \"fallback\",\n            \"reason\": \"Approaching recursion limit\"\n        }\n\n    # Normal processing\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [\"thinking...\"]}\n\ndef fallback_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Handle cases where recursion limit is approaching\"\"\"\n    return {\n        **state,\n        \"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [\"Reached complexity limit, providing best effort answer\"]\n    }\n\ndef route_based_on_state(state: dict) -> str:\n    if state.get(\"route_to\") == \"fallback\":\n        return \"fallback\"\n    elif state.get(\"done\"):\n        return END\n    return \"reasoning\"\n\n# Build graph\ngraph = StateGraph(dict)\ngraph.add_node(\"reasoning\", reasoning_node)\ngraph.add_node(\"fallback\", fallback_node)\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"reasoning\", route_based_on_state)\ngraph.add_edge(\"fallback\", END)\ngraph.set_entry_point(\"reasoning\")\n\napp = graph.compile()\n```\n\n#### Proactive vs reactive approaches\n\nThere are two main approaches to handling recursion limits: proactive (monitoring within the graph) and reactive (catching errors externally).\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\nfrom langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError\n\n# Proactive Approach (recommended)\ndef agent_with_monitoring(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Proactively monitor and handle recursion within the graph\"\"\"\n    current_step = config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]\n    recursion_limit = config[\"recursion_limit\"]\n\n    # Early detection - route to internal handling\n    if current_step >= recursion_limit - 2:  # 2 steps before limit\n        return {\n            **state,\n            \"status\": \"recursion_limit_approaching\",\n            \"final_answer\": \"Reached iteration limit, returning partial result\"\n        }\n\n    # Normal processing\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [f\"Step {current_step}\"]}\n\n# Reactive Approach (fallback)\ntry:\n    result = graph.invoke(initial_state, {\"recursion_limit\": 10})\nexcept GraphRecursionError as e:\n    # Handle externally after graph execution fails\n    result = fallback_handler(initial_state)\n```\n\nThe key differences between these approaches are:\n\n| Approach                                  | Detection            | Handling                             | Control Flow                       |\n| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| Proactive (using `langgraph_step`)        | Before limit reached | Inside graph via conditional routing | Graph continues to completion node |\n| Reactive (catching `GraphRecursionError`) | After limit exceeded | Outside graph in try/catch           | Graph execution terminated         |\n\n**Proactive advantages:**\n\n* Graceful degradation within the graph\n* Can save intermediate state in checkpoints\n* Better user experience with partial results\n* Graph completes normally (no exception)\n\n**Reactive advantages:**\n\n* Simpler implementation\n* No need to modify graph logic\n* Centralized error handling\n\n#### Other available metadata\n\nAlong with `langgraph_step`, the following metadata is also available in `config[\"metadata\"]`:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef inspect_metadata(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    metadata = config[\"metadata\"]\n\n    print(f\"Step: {metadata['langgraph_step']}\")\n    print(f\"Node: {metadata['langgraph_node']}\")\n    print(f\"Triggers: {metadata['langgraph_triggers']}\")\n    print(f\"Path: {metadata['langgraph_path']}\")\n    print(f\"Checkpoint NS: {metadata['langgraph_checkpoint_ns']}\")\n\n    return state\n```\n\n## Visualization\n\nIt's often nice to be able to visualize graphs, especially as they get more complex. LangGraph comes with several built-in ways to visualize graphs.
