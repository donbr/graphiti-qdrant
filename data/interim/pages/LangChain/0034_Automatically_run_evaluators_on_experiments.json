  "content": "LangSmith supports two ways to grade experiments created via the SDK:\n\n* **Programmatically**, by specifying evaluators in your code (see [this guide](/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application) for details)\n* By **binding evaluators to a dataset** in the UI. This will automatically run the evaluators on any new experiments created, in addition to any evaluators you've set up via the SDK. This is useful when you're iterating on your application (target function), and have a standard set of evaluators you want to run for all experiments.\n\n## Configuring an evaluator on a dataset\n\n1. Click on the **Datasets and Experiments** tab in the sidebar.\n2. Select the dataset you want to configure the evaluator for.\n3. Click on the **+ Evaluator** button to add an evaluator to the dataset. This will open a pane you can use to configure the evaluator.\n\n<Note>\n  When you configure an evaluator for a dataset, it will only affect the experiment runs that are created after the evaluator is configured. It will not affect the evaluation of experiment runs that were created before the evaluator was configured.\n</Note>\n\n## LLM-as-a-judge evaluators\n\nThe process for binding evaluators to a dataset is very similar to the process for configuring a LLM-as-a-judge evaluator in the Playground. View instructions for [configuring an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator in the Playground.](/langsmith/llm-as-judge?mode=ui)\n\n## Custom code evaluators\n\nThe process for binding a code evaluators to a dataset is very similar to the process for configuring a code evaluator in online evaluation. View instruction for [configuring code evaluators](/langsmith/online-evaluations#configure-a-custom-code-evaluator).\n\nThe only difference between configuring a code evaluator in online evaluation and binding a code evaluator to a dataset is that the custom code evaluator can reference outputs that are part of the dataset's `Example`.\n\nFor custom code evaluators bound to a dataset, the evaluator function takes in two arguments:\n\n* A `Run` ([reference](/langsmith/run-data-format)). This represents the new run in your experiment. For example, if you ran an experiment via SDK, this would contain the input/output from your chain or model you are testing.\n* An `Example` ([reference](/langsmith/example-data-format)). This represents the reference example in your dataset that the chain or model you are testing uses. The `inputs` to the Run and Example should be the same. If your Example has a reference `outputs`, then you can use this to compare to the run's output for scoring.\n\nThe code below shows an example of a simple evaluator function that checks that the outputs exactly equal the reference outputs.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```python Python theme={null}\n  import numpy as np\n\n  def perform_eval(run, example):\n      # run is a Run object\n      # example is an Example object\n      output = run['outputs']['output']\n      ref_output = example['outputs']['outputs']\n      output_match = np.array_equal(output, ref_output)\n\n      return { \"exact_match\": output_match }\n  ```\n\n  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}\n  function perform_eval(run, example) {\n      // run is a Run object\n      // example is an Example object\n      const output = run.outputs.output;\n      const refOutput = example.outputs.outputs;\n\n      // Deep equality check for arrays/objects\n      const outputMatch = JSON.stringify(output) === JSON.stringify(refOutput);\n\n      return { \"exact_match\": outputMatch };\n  }\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Next steps\n\n* Analyze your experiment results in the [experiments tab](/langsmith/analyze-an-experiment)\n* Compare your experiment results in the [comparison view](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results)\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/bind-evaluator-to-dataset.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
