  "content": "A LangGraph application consists of one or more graphs, a configuration file (`langgraph.json`), a file that specifies dependencies, and an optional `.env` file that specifies environment variables.\n\nThis guide shows a typical structure of an application and shows you how to provide the required configuration to deploy an application with [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments).\n\n<Info>\n  LangSmith Deployment is a managed hosting platform for deploying and scaling LangGraph agents. It handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy your stateful, long-running agents directly from your repository. Learn more in the [Deployment documentation](/langsmith/deployments).\n</Info>\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nTo deploy using the LangSmith, the following information should be provided:\n\n1. A [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) (`langgraph.json`) that specifies the dependencies, graphs, and environment variables to use for the application.\n2. The [graphs](#graphs) that implement the logic of the application.\n3. A file that specifies [dependencies](#dependencies) required to run the application.\n4. [Environment variables](#environment-variables) that are required for the application to run.\n\n## File structure\n\nBelow are examples of directory structures for applications:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python (requirements.txt)\">\n    ```plaintext  theme={null}\n    my-app/\n    ├── my_agent # all project code lies within here\n    │   ├── utils # utilities for your graph\n    │   │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   │   ├── tools.py # tools for your graph\n    │   │   ├── nodes.py # node functions for your graph\n    │   │   └── state.py # state definition of your graph\n    │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   └── agent.py # code for constructing your graph\n    ├── .env # environment variables\n    ├── requirements.txt # package dependencies\n    └── langgraph.json # configuration file for LangGraph\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Python (pyproject.toml)\">\n    ```plaintext  theme={null}\n    my-app/\n    ├── my_agent # all project code lies within here\n    │   ├── utils # utilities for your graph\n    │   │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   │   ├── tools.py # tools for your graph\n    │   │   ├── nodes.py # node functions for your graph\n    │   │   └── state.py # state definition of your graph\n    │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   └── agent.py # code for constructing your graph\n    ├── .env # environment variables\n    ├── langgraph.json  # configuration file for LangGraph\n    └── pyproject.toml # dependencies for your project\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Note>\n  The directory structure of a LangGraph application can vary depending on the programming language and the package manager used.\n</Note>\n\n<a id=\"configuration-file-concepts\" />\n\n## Configuration file\n\nThe `langgraph.json` file is a JSON file that specifies the dependencies, graphs, environment variables, and other settings required to deploy a LangGraph application.\n\nSee the [LangGraph configuration file reference](/langsmith/cli#configuration-file) for details on all supported keys in the JSON file.\n\n<Tip>\n  The [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli) defaults to using the configuration file `langgraph.json` in the current directory.\n</Tip>\n\n### Examples\n\n* The dependencies involve a custom local package and the `langchain_openai` package.\n* A single graph will be loaded from the file `./your_package/your_file.py` with the variable `variable`.\n* The environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\"langchain_openai\", \"./your_package\"],\n  \"graphs\": {\n    \"my_agent\": \"./your_package/your_file.py:agent\"\n  },\n  \"env\": \"./.env\"\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nA LangGraph application may depend on other Python packages.\n\nYou will generally need to specify the following information for dependencies to be set up correctly:\n\n1. A file in the directory that specifies the dependencies (e.g. `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `package.json`).\n\n2. A `dependencies` key in the [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) that specifies the dependencies required to run the LangGraph application.\n\n3. Any additional binaries or system libraries can be specified using `dockerfile_lines` key in the [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts).\n\n## Graphs\n\nUse the `graphs` key in the [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) to specify which graphs will be available in the deployed LangGraph application.\n\nYou can specify one or more graphs in the configuration file. Each graph is identified by a name (which should be unique) and a path for either: (1) the compiled graph or (2) a function that makes a graph is defined.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nIf you're working with a deployed LangGraph application locally, you can configure environment variables in the `env` key of the [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts).\n\nFor a production deployment, you will typically want to configure the environment variables in the deployment environment.\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/langgraph/application-structure.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
