  "content": "All functionality related to Anthropic models..\n\n[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude.\nThis page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain.\n\n## Prompting Best Practices\n\nAnthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models.\n\n**System Messages may only be the first message**\n\nAnthropic models require any system messages to be the first one in your prompts.\n\n## `ChatAnthropic`\n\n`ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain's `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`.\nYou can import this wrapper with the following code:\n\n<Tip>\n  See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).\n</Tip>\n\n```bash npm theme={null}\nnpm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/core\n```\n\n```typescript  theme={null}\nimport { ChatAnthropic } from \"@langchain/anthropic\";\nconst model = new ChatAnthropic({});\n```\n\nWhen working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s.\nHere is an example below of doing that:\n\n```typescript  theme={null}\nimport { ChatPromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/classic/prompts\";\n\nconst prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n  [\"system\", \"You are a helpful chatbot\"],\n  [\"human\", \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\"],\n]);\n```\n\nYou can then use this in a chain as follows:\n\n```typescript  theme={null}\nconst chain = prompt.pipe(model);\nawait chain.invoke({ topic: \"bears\" });\n```\n\nSee the [chat model integration page](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/anthropic/) for more examples, including multimodal inputs.\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/javascript/integrations/providers/anthropic.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
