  "content": "[Agent Server](/langsmith/agent-server) is an API platform for creating and managing agent-based applications. It provides built-in persistence, a task queue, and supports deploying, configuring, and running assistants (agentic workflows) at scale. This changelog documents all notable updates, features, and fixes to Agent Server releases.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-24\" />\n\n## v0.5.26\n\n* Resolved issues with `store.put` when used without AsyncBatchedStore in the JavaScript environment.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-22\" />\n\n## v0.5.25\n\n* Introduced the ability to search assistants by their `name` using a new endpoint.\n* Casted store\\_get return types to tuple in JavaScript to ensure type consistency.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-21\" />\n\n## v0.5.24\n\n* Added executor metrics for Datadog and enhanced core stream API metrics for better performance tracking.\n* Disabled Redis Go maintenance notifications to prevent startup errors with unsupported commands in Redis versions below 8.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-20\" />\n\n## v0.5.20\n\n* Resolved an error in the executor service that occurred when handling large messages.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-19\" />\n\n## v0.5.19\n\n* Upgraded built-in langchain-core to version 1.0.7 to address a prompt formatting vulnerability.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-19\" />\n\n## v0.5.18\n\n* Introduced persistent cron threads with `on_run_completed: {keep,delete}` for enhanced cron management and retrieval options.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-19\" />\n\n## v0.5.17\n\n* Enhanced task handling to support multiple interrupts, aligning with open-source functionality.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-18\" />\n\n## v0.5.15\n\n* Added custom JSON unmarshalling for `Resume` and `Goto` commands to fix map-style null resume interpretation issues.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-14\" />\n\n## v0.5.14\n\n* Ensured `pg make start` command functions correctly with core-api enabled.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-13\" />\n\n## v0.5.13\n\n* Support `include` and `exclude` (plural form key for `includes` and `excludes`) since a doc incorrectly claimed support for that. Now the server accepts either.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-10\" />\n\n## v0.5.11\n\n* Ensured auth handlers are applied consistently when streaming threads, aligning with recent security practices.\n* Bumped `undici` dependency from version 6.21.3 to 7.16.0, introducing various performance improvements and bug fixes.\n* Updated `p-queue` from version 8.0.1 to 9.0.0, introducing new features and breaking changes, including the removal of the `throwOnTimeout` option.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-10\" />\n\n## v0.5.10\n\n* Implemented healthcheck calls in the queue /ok handler to improve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probe compatibility.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-09\" />\n\n## v0.5.9\n\n* Resolved an issue causing an \"unbound local error\" for the `elapsed` variable during a SIGINT interruption.\n* Mapped the \"interrupted\" status to A2A's \"input-required\" status for better task status alignment.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-07\" />\n\n## v0.5.8\n\n* Ensured environment variables are passed as a dictionary when starting langgraph-ui for compatibility with `uvloop`.\n* Implemented CRUD operations for runs in Go, simplifying JSON merges and improving transaction readability, with PostgreSQL as a reference.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-07\" />\n\n## v0.5.7\n\n* Replaced no-retry Redis client with a retry client to handle connection errors more effectively and reduced corresponding logging severity.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-06\" />\n\n## v0.5.6\n\n* Added pending time metrics to provide better insights into task waiting times.\n* Replaced `pb.Value` with `ChannelValue` to streamline code structure.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-05\" />\n\n## v0.5.5\n\n* Made the Redis `health_check_interval` more frequent and configurable for better handling of idle connections.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-05\" />\n\n## v0.5.4\n\n* Implemented `ormsgpack` with `OPT_REPLACE_SURROGATES` and updated for compatibility with the latest FastAPI release affecting custom authentication dependencies.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-03\" />\n\n## v0.5.2\n\n* Added retry logic for PostgreSQL connections during startup to enhance deployment reliability and improved error logging for easier debugging.\n\n<a id=\"2025-11-03\" />\n\n## v0.5.1\n\n* Resolved an issue where persistence was not functioning correctly with LangChain.js's createAgent feature.\n* Optimized assistants CRUD performance by improving database connection pooling and gRPC client reuse, reducing latency for large payloads.\n\n<a id=\"2025-10-31\" />\n\n## v0.5.0\n\nThis minor version now requires langgraph-checkpoint versions later than 3.0 to prevent a deserialization vulnerability in earlier versions of the langgraph-checkpoint library.\nThe `langgraph-checkpoint` library is compatible with `langgraph` minor versions 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 1.0.\n\nThis version removes default support for deserialization of payloads saved using the \"json\" type, which has never been the default.\nBy default, objects are serialized using msgpack. Under certain uncommon situations, payloads were serialized using an older \"json\" mode. If those payloads contained custom python objects, those will no longer be deserializable unless you provide a `serde` config:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n    \"checkpointer\": {\n        \"serde\": {\n            \"allowed_json_modules\": [\n                [\"my_agent\", \"my_file\", \"SomeType\"],\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<a id=\"2025-10-29\" />\n\n## v0.4.47\n\n* Validated

sequentially executed runs.\n* Made the filter query builder in PostgreSQL more robust against malformed expressions and improved validation to prevent potential security risks.\n\nThis minor version also includes a couple of breaking changes to improve the usability and security of the service:\n\n* In this minor version, we stop the practice of automatically including headers as configurable values in your runs. You can opt-in to specific patterns by setting **configurable\\_headers** in your agent server config.\n* Run stream event IDs (for resumable streams) are now in the format of `ms-seq` instead of the previous format. We retain backwards compatibility for the old format, but we recommend using the new format for new code.\n\n<a id=\"2025-08-25\" />\n\n## v0.3.4\n\n* Added custom Prometheus metrics for Redis/PG connection pools and switched the queue server to Uvicorn/Starlette for improved monitoring.\n* Restored Wolfi image build by correcting shell command formatting and added a Makefile target for testing with nginx.\n\n<a id=\"2025-08-22\" />\n\n## v0.3.3\n\n* Added timeouts to specific Redis calls to prevent workers from being left active.\n* Updated the Golang runtime and added pytest skips for unsupported functionalities, including initial support for passing store to node and message streaming.\n* Introduced a reverse proxy setup for serving combined Python and Node.js graphs, with nginx handling server routing, to facilitate a Postgres/Redis backend for the Node.js API server.\n\n<a id=\"2025-08-21\" />\n\n## v0.3.1\n\n* Added a statement timeout to the pool to prevent long-running queries.\n\n<a id=\"2025-08-21\" />\n\n## v0.3.0\n\n* Set a default 15-minute statement timeout and implemented monitoring for long-running queries to ensure system efficiency.\n* Stop propagating run configurable values to the thread configuration, because this can cause issues on subsequent runs if you are specifying a checkpoint\\_id. This is a **slight breaking change** in behavior, since the thread value will no longer automatically reflect the unioned configuration of the most recent run. We believe this behavior is more intuitive, however.\n* Enhanced compatibility with older worker versions by handling event data in channel names within ops.py.\n\n<a id=\"2025-08-20\" />\n\n##
