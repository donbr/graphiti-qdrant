To view v0.x documentation, [go to the archived content](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/v0.3/docs/core_docs/docs).\n</Callout>\n\nLangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [more](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\n\nWe recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use [LangGraph](/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\n\nLangChain [agents](/oss/javascript/langchain/agents) are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.\n\n## <Icon icon=\"download\" size={20} /> Install\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash npm theme={null}\n  npm install langchain @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash pnpm theme={null}\n  pnpm add langchain @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash yarn theme={null}\n  yarn add langchain @langchain/core\n  ```\n\n  ```bash bun theme={null}\n  bun add langchain @langchain/core\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## <Icon icon=\"wand-magic-sparkles\" /> Create an agent\n\n```ts  theme={null}\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n// npm install @langchain/anthropic to call the model\nimport { createAgent, tool } from \"langchain\";\n\nconst getWeather = tool(\n  ({ city }) => `It's always sunny in ${city}!`,\n  {\n    name: \"get_weather\",\n    description: \"Get the weather for a given city\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      city: z.string(),\n    }),\n  },\n);\n\nconst agent = createAgent({\n  model: \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\n  tools: [getWeather],\n});\n\nconsole.log(\n  await agent.invoke({\n    messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\" }],\n  })\n);\n```\n\n## <Icon icon=\"star\" size={20} /> Core benefits\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Standard model interface\" icon=\"arrows-rotate\" href=\"/oss/javascript/langchain/models\" arrow cta=\"Learn more\">\n    Different providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses.
