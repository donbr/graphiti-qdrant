It's powered by [deep-agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents), and is not <Tooltip tip=\"Predetermined code paths that are designed to operate in a certain order.\">workflow based</Tooltip>.\n\n## Memory and updates\n\nAgent Builder includes persistent agent memory and supports self-updates. This lets agents adapt over time and refine how they work without manual edits.\n\n* Persistent memory: Agents retain relevant information across runs to inform future decisions.\n* What can be updated: Tools (add, remove, or reconfigure), and instructions/system prompts.\n* Agents cannot modify their name, description, and/or triggers attached.\n\n## Triggers\n\nTriggers define when your agent should start running. You can connect your agent to external tools or time-based schedules, letting it respond automatically to messages, emails, or recurring events.\n\nThe following examples show some of the apps you can use to trigger your agent:\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Slack\" icon=\"slack\">\n    Activate your agent when messages are received in specific Slack channels.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Gmail\" icon=\"envelope\">\n    Trigger your agent when emails are received.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Cron schedules\" icon=\"clock\">\n    Run your agent on a time-based schedule for recurring tasks.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Sub-agents\n\nAgent Builder lets you create sub-agents within a main agent. Sub-agents are smaller, specialized agents that handle specific parts of a larger task. They can operate with their own tools, permissions, or goals while coordinating with the main agent.\n\nUsing sub-agents makes it easier to build complex systems by dividing work into focused, reusable components. This modular approach helps keep your agents organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n\nBelow are a few ways sub-agents can be used in your projects:\n\n* Handle distinct parts of a broader workflow (for example, data retrieval, summarization, or formatting).\n* Use different tools or context windows for specialized tasks.\n* Run independently but report results back to the main agent.\n\n## Human in the loop\n\nHuman-in-the-loop functionality allows you to review and approve agent actions before they execute, giving you control over critical decisions.\n\n### Enabling interrupts\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Select a tool\">\n    When configuring your agent in Agent Builder, select the tool you want to add human oversight to.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enable interrupts\">\n    Look for the interrupt option when selecting the tool and toggle it on.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Agent pauses for approval\">\n    The agent will pause and wait for human approval before executing that tool.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Actions on interrupts\n\nWhen your agent reaches an interrupt point, you can take one of three actions:\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"Accept\" icon=\"check\">\n    Approve the agent's proposed action and allow it to proceed as planned.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Edit\" icon=\"pen-to-square\">\n    Modify the agent's message or parameters before allowing it to continue.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Send feedback\" icon=\"comment\">\n    Provide feedback to the agent.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/agent-builder.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
