  "content": "If you're not seeing traces in your tracing project or notice traces logged to the wrong project/workspace, the issue might be due to LangSmith's default environment variable caching. This is especially common when running LangSmith within a Jupyter notebook. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n## 1. Verify your environment variables\n\nFirst, check that the environment variables are set correctly by running:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport os\nprint(os.getenv(\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"))\nprint(os.getenv(\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"))\nprint(os.getenv(\"LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT\"))\nprint(os.getenv(\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"))\n```\n\nIf the output does not match what's defined in your .env file, it's likely due to environment variable caching.\n\n## 2. Clear the cache\n\nClear the cached environment variables with the following command:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nutils.get_env_var.cache_clear()\n```\n\n## 3. Reload the environment variables\n\nReload your environment variables from the .env file by executing:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\nload_dotenv(<path to .env file>, override=True)\n```\n\nAfter reloading, your environment variables should be set correctly.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please reach out to us via a shared Slack channel or email support (available for Plus and Enterprise plans), or in the [LangChain Forum](https://forum.langchain.com/).\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/troubleshooting-variable-caching.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
