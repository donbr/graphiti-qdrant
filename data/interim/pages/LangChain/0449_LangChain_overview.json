To view v0.x documentation, [go to the archived content](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/v0.3/docs/docs).\n</Callout>\n\nLangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [more](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\n\nWe recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\n\nLangChain [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.\n\n## <Icon icon=\"download\" size={20} /> Install\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash pip theme={null}\n  pip install -U langchain\n  # Requires Python 3.10+\n  ```\n\n  ```bash uv theme={null}\n  uv add langchain\n  # Requires Python 3.10+\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## <Icon icon=\"wand-magic-sparkles\" /> Create an agent\n\n```python  theme={null}\n# pip install -qU \"langchain[anthropic]\" to call the model\n\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\n\ndef get_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Get weather for a given city.\"\"\"\n    return f\"It's always sunny in {city}!\"\n\nagent = create_agent(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\n    tools=[get_weather],\n    system_prompt=\"You are a helpful assistant\",\n)\n\n# Run the agent\nagent.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"what is the weather in sf\"}]}\n)\n```\n\n## <Icon icon=\"star\" size={20} /> Core benefits\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Standard model interface\" icon=\"arrows-rotate\" href=\"/oss/python/langchain/models\" arrow cta=\"Learn more\">\n    Different providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses.
