  "content": "The **Functional API** allows you to add LangGraph's key features — [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory), [human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), and [streaming](/oss/python/langgraph/streaming) — to your applications with minimal changes to your existing code.\n\nIt is designed to integrate these features into existing code that may use standard language primitives for branching and control flow, such as `if` statements, `for` loops, and function calls. Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.\n\nThe Functional API uses two key building blocks:\n\n* **`@entrypoint`** – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\n* **[`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task)** – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.\n\nThis provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.\n\n<Tip>\n  For information on how to use the functional API, see [Use Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api).\n</Tip>\n\n## Functional API vs. Graph API\n\nFor users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph's [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.\n\nHere are some key differences:\n\n* **Control flow**: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.\n* **Short-term memory**: The **GraphAPI** requires declaring a [**State**](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state) and may require defining [**reducers**](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) to manage updates to the graph state. `@entrypoint` and `@tasks` do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.\n* **Checkpointing**: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the **Graph API** a new checkpoint is generated after every [superstep](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api). In the **Functional API**, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.\n* **Visualization**: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.\n\n## Example\n\nBelow we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and [interrupts](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) to request human review.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\n@task\ndef write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.\n    return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\ndef workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\n    essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\n    is_approved = interrupt({\n        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\n        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\n        # from the workflow.\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.\n        # We can add any additional information that we need.\n        # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\n        \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\n    })\n\n    return {\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay that was generated\n        \"is_approved\": is_approved, # Response from HIL\n    }\n```\n\n<Accordion title=\"Detailed Explanation\">\n  This workflow will write an essay about the topic \"cat\" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.\n\n  When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `writeEssay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.\n\n  ```python  theme={null}\n  import time\n  import uuid\n  from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\n  from langgraph.types import interrupt\n  from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\n\n  @task\n  def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\n      \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\n      time.sleep(1)  # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.\n      return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\n\n  @entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\n  def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\n      \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\n      essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\n      is_approved = interrupt(\n          {\n              # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\n              # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\n              # from the workflow.\n              \"essay\": essay,  # The essay we want reviewed.\n              # We can add any additional information that we need.\n              # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\n              \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\n          }\n      )\n      return {\n          \"essay\": essay,  # The essay that was generated\n          \"is_approved\": is_approved,  # Response from HIL\n      }\n\n\n  thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n  config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id}}\n  for item in workflow.stream(\"cat\", config):\n      print(item)\n  # > {'write_essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}\n  # > {\n  # >     '__interrupt__': (\n  # >        Interrupt(\n  # >            value={\n  # >                'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat',\n  # >                'action': 'Please approve/reject the essay'\n  # >            },\n  # >            id='b9b2b9d788f482663ced6dc755c9e981'\n  # >        ),\n  # >    )\n  # > }\n  ```\n\n  An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:\n\n  ```python  theme={null}\n  from langgraph.types import Command\n\n  # Get review from a user (e.g., via a UI)\n  # In this case, we're using a bool, but this can be any json-serializable value.\n  human_review = True\n\n  for item in workflow.stream(Command(resume=human_review), config):\n      print(item)\n  ```\n\n  ```pycon  theme={null}\n  {'workflow': {'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'is_approved': False}}\n  ```\n\n  The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.\n</Accordion>\n\n## Entrypoint\n\nThe [`@entrypoint`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint) decorator can be used to create a workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling *long-running tasks* and [interrupts](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts).\n\n### Definition\n\nAn **entrypoint** is defined by decorating a function with the `@entrypoint` decorator.\n\nThe function **must accept a single positional argument**, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.\n\nDecorating a function with an `entrypoint` produces a [`Pregel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel.stream) instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).\n\nYou will usually want to pass a **checkpointer** to the `@entrypoint` decorator to enable persistence and use features like **human-in-the-loop**.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\n        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.\n        ...\n        return result\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    async def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\n        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop\n        ...\n        return result\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Serialization**\n  The **inputs** and **outputs** of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the [serialization](#serialization) section for more details.\n</Warning>\n\n### Injectable parameters\n\nWhen declaring an `entrypoint`, you can request access to additional parameters that will be injected automatically at run time. These parameters include:\n\n| Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **previous** | Access the state associated with the previous `checkpoint` for the given thread. See [short-term-memory](#short-term-memory).                                               |\n| **store**    | An instance of \\[BaseStore]\\[langgraph.store.base.BaseStore]. Useful for [long-term memory](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api#long-term-memory).                     |\n| **writer**   | Use to access the StreamWriter when working with Async Python \\< 3.11. See [streaming with functional API for details](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api#streaming). |\n| **config**   | For accessing run time configuration. See [RunnableConfig](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/#runnableconfig) for information.                           |\n\n<Warning>\n  Declare the parameters with the appropriate name and type annotation.\n</Warning>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Requesting Injectable Parameters\">\n  ```python  theme={null}\n  from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\n  from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n  from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore\n  from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore\n\n  in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(...)  # An instance of InMemoryStore for long-term memory\n\n  @entrypoint(\n      checkpointer=checkpointer,  # Specify the checkpointer\n      store=in_memory_store  # Specify the store\n  )\n  def my_workflow(\n      some_input: dict,  # The input (e.g., passed via `invoke`)\n      *,\n      previous: Any = None, # For short-term memory\n      store: BaseStore,  # For long-term memory\n      writer: StreamWriter,  # For streaming custom data\n      config: RunnableConfig  # For accessing the configuration passed to the entrypoint\n  ) -> ...:\n  ```\n</Accordion>\n\n### Executing\n\nUsing the [`@entrypoint`](#entrypoint) yields a [`Pregel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel.stream) object that can be executed using the `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, and `astream` methods.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n    my_workflow.invoke(some_input, config)  # Wait for the result synchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n    await my_workflow.ainvoke(some_input, config)  # Await result asynchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    for chunk in my_workflow.stream(some_input, config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(some_input, config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Resuming\n\nResuming an execution after an [interrupt](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) can be done by passing a **resume** value to the [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) primitive.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.types import Command\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    my_workflow.invoke(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.types import Command\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    await my_workflow.ainvoke(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.types import Command\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    for chunk in my_workflow.stream(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.types import Command\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n**Resuming after an error**\n\nTo resume after an error, run the `entrypoint` with a `None` and the same **thread id** (config).\n\nThis assumes that the underlying **error** has been resolved and execution can proceed successfully.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    my_workflow.invoke(None, config)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Invoke\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    await my_workflow.ainvoke(None, config)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    for chunk in my_workflow.stream(None, config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async Stream\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(None, config):\n        print(chunk)\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Short-term memory\n\nWhen an `entrypoint` is defined with a `checkpointer`, it stores information between successive invocations on the same **thread id** in [checkpoints](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints).\n\nThis allows accessing the state from the previous invocation using the `previous` parameter.\n\nBy default, the `previous` parameter is the return value of the previous invocation.\n\n```python  theme={null}\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(number: int, *, previous: Any = None) -> int:\n    previous = previous or 0\n    return number + previous\n\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"some_thread_id\"\n    }\n}\n\nmy_workflow.invoke(1, config)  # 1 (previous was None)\nmy_workflow.invoke(2, config)  # 3 (previous was 1 from the previous invocation)\n```\n\n#### `entrypoint.final`\n\n[`entrypoint.final`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint.final) is a special primitive that can be returned from an entrypoint and allows **decoupling** the value that is **saved in the checkpoint** from the **return value of the entrypoint**.\n\nThe first value is the return value of the entrypoint, and the second value is the value that will be saved in the checkpoint. The type annotation is `entrypoint.final[return_type, save_type]`.\n\n```python  theme={null}\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(number: int, *, previous: Any = None) -> entrypoint.final[int, int]:\n    previous = previous or 0\n    # This will return the previous value to the caller, saving\n    # 2 * number to the checkpoint, which will be used in the next invocation\n    # for the `previous` parameter.\n    return entrypoint.final(value=previous, save=2 * number)\n\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"1\"\n    }\n}\n\nmy_workflow.invoke(3, config)  # 0 (previous was None)\nmy_workflow.invoke(1, config)  # 6 (previous was 3 * 2 from the previous invocation)\n```\n\n## Task\n\nA **task** represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step. It has two key characteristics:\n\n* **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.\n* **Checkpointing**: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) for more details).\n\n### Definition\n\nTasks are defined using the `@task` decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.func import task\n\n@task()\ndef slow_computation(input_value):\n    # Simulate a long-running operation\n    ...\n    return result\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  **Serialization**\n  The **outputs** of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.\n</Warning>\n\n### Execution\n\n**Tasks** can only be called from within an **entrypoint**, another **task**, or a [state graph node](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes).\n\nTasks *cannot* be called directly from the main application code.\n\nWhen you call a **task**, it returns *immediately* with a future object. A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.\n\nTo obtain the result of a **task**, you can either wait for it synchronously (using `result()`) or await it asynchronously (using `await`).\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Synchronous Invocation\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\n        future = slow_computation(some_input)\n        return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Asynchronous Invocation\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    async def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\n        return await slow_computation(some_input)  # Await result asynchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## When to use a task\n\n**Tasks** are useful in the following scenarios:\n\n* **Checkpointing**: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don't need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.\n* **Human-in-the-loop**: If you're building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use **tasks** to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the [determinism](#determinism) section for more details.\n* **Parallel Execution**: For I/O-bound tasks, **tasks** enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).\n* **Observability**: Wrapping operations in **tasks** provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).\n* **Retryable Work**: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, **tasks** provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.\n\n## Serialization\n\nThere are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:\n\n1. `entrypoint` inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.\n2. `task` outputs must be JSON-serializable.\n\nThese requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.\n\nSerialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.\n\nProviding non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.\n\n## Determinism\n\nTo utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same *sequence of steps*, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.\n\nLangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](/oss/python/langgraph/use-subgraphs) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the *same sequence of steps*, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.\n\nWhile different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.\n\n## Idempotency\n\nIdempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside **tasks** functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a **task** starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the **task** will run again.

LangGraph keeps a list of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it's matched with the corresponding resume value. This matching is strictly **index-based**, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.\n\nIf order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) call may be matched with the wrong `resume` value, leading to incorrect results.\n\nPlease read the section on [determinism](#determinism) for more details.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Incorrect\">\n    In this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.\n\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n        t0 = inputs[\"t0\"]\n        t1 = time.time()  # [!code highlight]\n\n        delta_t = t1 - t0\n\n        if delta_t > 1:\n            result = slow_task(1).result()\n            value = interrupt(\"question\")\n        else:\n            result = slow_task(2).result()\n            value = interrupt(\"question\")\n\n        return {\n            \"result\": result,\n            \"value\": value\n        }\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Correct\">\n    In this example, the workflow uses the input `t0` to determine which task to execute. This is deterministic because the result of the workflow depends only on the input.\n\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    import time\n\n    from langgraph.func import task\n\n    @task  # [!code highlight]\n    def get_time() -> float:  # [!code highlight]\n        return time.time()\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n        t0 = inputs[\"t0\"]\n        t1 = get_time().result()  # [!code highlight]\n\n        delta_t = t1 - t0\n\n        if delta_t > 1:\n            result = slow_task(1).result()\n            value = interrupt(\"question\")\n        else:\n            result = slow_task(2).result()\n            value = interrupt(\"question\")\n\n        return {\n            \"result\": result,\n            \"value\": value\n        }\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit the source of this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/langgraph/functional-api.mdx)\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs programmatically](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
