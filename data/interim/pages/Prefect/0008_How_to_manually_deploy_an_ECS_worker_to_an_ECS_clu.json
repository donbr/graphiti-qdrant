  "content": "Step-by-step guide for manually setting up ECS infrastructure to run Prefect workers with full control over cluster configuration, IAM roles, and task definitions.\n\n<Note>\n  This guide is valid for users of self-hosted Prefect server or Prefect Cloud users with a tier that allows hybrid work pools.\n</Note>\n\nThis guide walks you through manually setting up ECS infrastructure to run Prefect workers. For architecture concepts and overview, see the [ECS Worker overview](/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs-worker).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou will need the following to successfully complete this guide:\n\n* A Prefect server. You will need either:\n  * [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud) account on Starter tier or above\n  * [Prefect self-managed instance](/v3/concepts/server)\n* An AWS account with permissions to create:\n  * IAM roles\n  * IAM policies\n  * Secrets in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) or [Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)\n  * ECS task definitions\n  * ECS services\n* The AWS CLI installed on your local machine. You can [download it from the AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n* An existing [ECS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html)\n* An existing [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) - this guide assumes the use the default VPC.\n\n<Accordion title={\"What if I don't have an ECS cluster?\"} icon={\"boxes-stacked\"}>\n  You can create an ECS cluster using the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.\n\n  To create an ECS cluster using the AWS CLI, run the following command:\n\n  ```bash wrap theme={null}\n  aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name my-ecs-cluster\n  ```\n\n  <Info>\n    No further configuration is required for this guide, as we will use the Fargate launch type and the default VPC.\n  </Info>\n</Accordion>\n\n<Tip>\n  For production deployments, it is recommended that you create your own VPC with appropriate security policies based on your organization's recommendations.\n\n  If you want to create a new VPC for this guide, follow the [VPC creation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html).\n</Tip>\n\n## Create the Prefect ECS work pool\n\nFirst, create an ECS [work pool](/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools/) for your deployments to use. You can do this either from the CLI or the Prefect UI.\n\nIf doing so from the CLI, be sure to [authenticate with Prefect Cloud](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/connect-to-cloud) or run a local Prefect server instance.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title={\"From the CLI\"}>\n    Run the following command to create a new ECS work pool named `my-ecs-pool`:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    prefect work-pool create --type ecs my-ecs-pool\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title={\"From the Web UI\"}>\n    1. Navigate to the **Work Pools** page in the Prefect UI.\n    2. Click the `+` button to the right of the **Work Pool** page header.\n    3. Select **AWS Elastic Container Service**. In Prefect Cloud, this will be under the **Hybrid** section.\n\n    <img src={\"/images/Workpool_UI.png\"} alt={\"Work Pool\"} noZoom />\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Info>\n  Because this guide uses Fargate as the capacity provider, this step requires no further action.\n</Info>\n\n## Create a Secret for the Prefect API key\n\n<Info>\n  If you are using a Prefect self-hosted server and have authentication disabled, you can skip this step.\n</Info>\n\nThe Prefect worker needs to authenticate with your Prefect server to poll the work pool for flow runs. For authentication, you must provide a Bearer token (`PREFECT_API_KEY`) or Basic Auth string (`PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING`) to the Prefect API. As a security best practice, we recommend you store your Prefect API key in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) or [Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html).\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title={\"Find your secret\"}>\n    You can find your Prefect API key several ways:\n\n    <AccordionGroup>\n      <Accordion title={\"Prefect Cloud - Paid Plans\"}>\n        If you are on a paid plan you can create a [service account](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/manage-users/service-accounts) for the worker.\n      </Accordion>\n\n      <Accordion title={\"Prefect Cloud - Free Plans\"}>\n        If you are on a free plan, you can use a user's API key.\n\n        To find your API key, use the Prefect CLI:\n\n        ```bash wrap theme={null}\n        # If not already authenticated, log in first\n        prefect cloud login\n\n        prefect config view --show-secrets\n        ```\n      </Accordion>\n\n      <Accordion title={\"Self-hosted Prefect server\"}>\n        There is no concept of a `PREFECT_API_KEY` in a self-hosted Prefect server.\n\n        Instead, you use the `PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING` containing your basic auth credentials (if your server uses [basic authentication](/v3/advanced/security-settings#basic-authentication)).\n\n        You can find this information on the Settings page for your Prefect server.\n      </Accordion>\n    </AccordionGroup>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Create a secret\"}>\n    Choose between AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store to store your Prefect API key. Both services allow you to securely store and manage sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title={\"Secrets Manager\"}>\n        To create a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager, use the [`aws secretsmanager create-secret`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/create-secret.html) command:\n\n        ```bash wrap theme={null}\n        aws secretsmanager create-secret --name PrefectECSWorkerAPIKey --secret-string '<your-prefect-api-key>'\n        ```\n\n        Make a note of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret that is returned in the command output. You will need it later when configuring the ECS worker task definition.\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title={\"Systems Manager Parameter Store\"}>\n        To create a SecureString parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, use the [`aws ssm put-parameter`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/put-parameter.html) command:\n\n        ```bash wrap theme={null}\n        aws ssm put-parameter --name \"/prefect/my-ecs-pool/api/key\" --value \"<your-prefect-api-key>\" --type \"SecureString\"\n        ```\n\n        You may customize the parameter hierarchy and name to suit your needs. In this example we've used, `/prefect/my-ecs-pool/api/key` but any parameter name works. Your ECS task execution role will need to be able to read this value.\n\n        Make a note of the name you specified for the parameter, as you will need it later when configuring the ECS worker.\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Create the AWS IAM resources\n\nWe will create two [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html#roles-creatingrole-custom-trust-policy-console):\n\n1. `ecsTaskExecutionRole`: This role will be used by ECS to start ECS tasks.\n2. `ecsTaskRole`: This role will contain the permissions required by Prefect ECS worker in order to run your flows as ECS tasks.\n\nThe role permissions are based on the principle of [least-privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-reduce-permissions.html), meaning that each role will only have the permissions it needs to perform its job.\n\n### Create a trust policy\n\nThe trust policy will allow the ECS service containing the Prefect worker to assume the role required for calling other AWS services. This is called a [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html). The trust policy is a JSON document that specifies which AWS service can assume the role.\n\nSave this policy to a file, such as `trust-policy.json`:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Service\": \"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAlternately, you can download this file using the following command:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash curl wrap theme={null}\n  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/trust-policy.json\n  ```\n\n  ```bash wget wrap theme={null}\n  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/trust-policy.json\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Create the IAM roles\n\nNow, we will create the IAM roles that will be used by the ECS worker.\n\n#### Create the ECS task execution role\n\nThe ECS task execution role will be used to start the ECS worker task. We will assign it a minimal set of permissions to allow the worker to pull images from ECR and publish logs to CloudWatch.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title={\"Create the role\"}>\n    Create the role using the [`aws iam create-role`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-role.html) command:\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws iam create-role --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json\n    ```\n\n    Make a note of the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the role that is returned in the command output. You will need it later when creating the ECS task definition.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Create the Secret Policy\"}>\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title={\"Secrets Manager\"}>\n        The following is a minimal policy that grants the necessary permissions for ECS to obtain the current value of the secret and inject it into the ECS task. Save this policy to a file, such as `secret-policy.json`:\n\n        ```json  theme={null}\n        {\n            \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n            \"Statement\": [\n                {\n                    \"Action\": [\n                        \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n                    ],\n                    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                    \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:PrefectECSWorkerAPIKey\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Alternately, you can download this file using the following command:\n\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```bash curl wrap theme={null}\n          curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/secrets/secrets-manager/secret-policy.json\n          ```\n\n          ```bash wget wrap theme={null}\n          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/secrets/secrets-manager/secret-policy.json\n          ```\n        </CodeGroup>\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title={\"Systems Manager Parameter Store\"}>\n        The following is a minimal policy that grants the necessary permissions for ECS to obtain the current value of the parameter and inject it into the ECS task. Save this policy to a file, such as `secret-policy.json`:\n\n        ```json  theme={null}\n        {\n            \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n            \"Statement\": [\n                {\n                    \"Action\": [\n                        \"ssm:GetParameters\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                    \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:ssm:<region>:<account-id>:parameter/prefect/my-ecs-pool/api/key\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Alternately, you can download this file using the following command:\n\n        <CodeGroup>\n          ```bash curl wrap theme={null}\n          curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/secrets/ssm-parameter-store/secret-policy.json\n          ```\n\n          ```bash wget wrap theme={null}\n          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/refs/heads/main/docs/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs/iam/secrets/ssm-parameter-store/secret-policy.json\n          ```\n        </CodeGroup>\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    <Accordion title={\"Using a customer-managed key (CMK)?\"} icon={\"lock\"}>\n      If your secret is encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS), you will also need to add the `kms:Decrypt` permission to the policy. For example:\n\n      ```json focus={11-17} theme={null}\n      {\n        \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n        \"Statement\": [\n          {\n              \"Action\": [\n                  \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n              ],\n              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n              \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:PrefectECSWorkerAPIKey\"\n          },\n          {\n             \"Action\": [\n                  \"kms:Decrypt\"\n              ],\n              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n              \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<your-kms-key-id>\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n      ```\n    </Accordion>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Register the policy\"}>\n    Create a new IAM policy named `ecsTaskExecutionPolicy` using the policy document you just created.\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws iam create-policy --policy-name ecsTaskExecutionPolicy --policy-document file://secret-policy.json\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Attach the Policies\"}>\n    The `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` managed policy grants the minimum permissions necessary for starting ECS tasks. [See here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html) for other common execution role permissions.\n\n    Attach this policy to your task execution role using the [`aws iam attach-role-policy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-role-policy.html):\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\n    ```\n\n    Attach the custom policy you created in the previous step so that the ECS task can access the Prefect API key stored in AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store:\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws iam put-role-policy --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --policy-name PrefectECSWorkerSecretPolicy --policy-document file://secret-policy.json\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n#### Create the worker ECS task role\n\nThe worker ECS task role will be used by the Prefect worker to interact with the AWS API to run flows as ECS containers. This role will require the ability to describe, register, and deregister ECS task definitions, as well as the ability to start and stop ECS tasks.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title={\"Create the role\"}>\n    Use the following command to create the role. The same trust policy is also used for this role.\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws iam create-role --role-name ecsTaskRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Create the task policy\"}>\n    The following is a minimal policy that grants the necessary permissions for the Prefect ECS worker to run your flows as ECS tasks.

This role will contain the permissions required by the ECS tasks in which your flows will run. For example, if your workflow loads data into an S3 bucket, you would need a role with additional permissions to access S3.\n\n<Accordion title={\"Create flow run IAM role\"} icon={\"lock\"}>\n  <Steps>\n    <Step title={\"Create the role\"}>\n      Use the following command to create the role:\n\n      ```bash wrap theme={null}\n      aws iam create-role --role-name PrefectECSRunnerTaskRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json\n      ```\n    </Step>\n\n    <Step title={\"Create the task policy\"}>\n      The following is an example policy that allows reading/writing to an S3 bucket named `prefect-demo-bucket`.

Globally for all flows in the work pool by setting the **Task Role ARN (Optional)** field in the work pool configuration.\n      2. On a per-deployment basis by specifying the `task_role_arn` job variable in the deployment configuration.\n    </Step>\n  </Steps>\n</Accordion>\n\n## Configure event monitoring infrastructure\n\nTo enable the ECS worker to monitor and update the status of flow runs, we need to set up SQS queues and EventBridge rules that capture ECS task state changes. This infrastructure allows the worker to:\n\n* Track when ECS tasks (flow runs) start, stop, or fail\n* Update flow run states in real-time based on ECS task events\n* Provide better observability and status reporting for your workflows\n\n<Info>\n  This step sets up the same event monitoring infrastructure that the `prefect-aws ecs-worker deploy-events` command creates automatically. The worker will use the environment variable `PREFECT_INTEGRATIONS_AWS_ECS_OBSERVER_SQS_QUEUE_NAME` to discover and read from the events queue.\n</Info>\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title={\"Create SQS queues for event monitoring\"}>\n    Create an SQS queue to receive ECS task state change events and a dead-letter queue for handling failed messages.\n\n    First, create the dead-letter queue:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    aws sqs create-queue --queue-name my-ecs-pool-events-dlq --attributes MessageRetentionPeriod=1209600,VisibilityTimeout=60\n    ```\n\n    Get the ARN of the dead-letter queue:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url $(aws sqs get-queue-url --queue-name my-ecs-pool-events-dlq --query 'QueueUrl' --output text) --attribute-names QueueArn --query 'Attributes.QueueArn' --output text\n    ```\n\n    Now create the main queue with the dead-letter queue configured:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    aws sqs create-queue \\\n      --queue-name my-ecs-pool-events \\\n      --attributes '{\n        \"MessageRetentionPeriod\": \"604800\",\n        \"VisibilityTimeout\": \"300\",\n        \"RedrivePolicy\": \"{\\\"deadLetterTargetArn\\\":\\\"<dlq-arn>\\\",\\\"maxReceiveCount\\\":3}\"\n      }'\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<dlq-arn>` with the ARN of the dead-letter queue from the previous step, and

The name you choose for your repository will be reused in the next step when defining your Prefect deployment.\n\n    ```bash wrap theme={null}\n    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <my-ecr-repo>\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Create a `prefect.yaml` file\"}>\n    To have Prefect build your image when deploying your flow create a `prefect.yaml` file with the following specification:\n\n    ```yaml prefect.yaml lines theme={null}\n    name: ecs-worker-guide\n\n    pull:\n    - prefect.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:\n        directory: /opt/prefect/ecs-worker-guide\n\n    # build section allows you to manage and build docker images\n    build:\n    - prefect_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:\n        id: build_image\n        requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.1\n        image_name: <my-ecr-repo>\n        tag: latest\n        dockerfile: auto\n\n    # push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations\n    push:\n    - prefect_docker.deployments.steps.push_docker_image:\n        requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.1\n        image_name: '{{ build_image.image_name }}'\n        tag: '{{ build_image.tag }}'\n\n     # the deployments section allows you to provide configuration for deploying flows\n    deployments:\n    - name: my_ecs_deployment\n        version:\n        tags: []\n        description:\n        entrypoint: flow.py:my_flow\n        parameters: {}\n        work_pool:\n          name: my-ecs-pool\n          work_queue_name:\n          job_variables:\n            image: '{{ build_image.image }}'\n        schedules: []\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Deploy the flow\"}>\n    [Deploy](https://docs.prefect.io/deploy/serve-flows/#create-a-deployment) the flow to the Prefect Cloud or your self-managed server instance.\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    prefect deploy my_flow.py:my_ecs_deployment\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title={\"Run!\"}>\n    Find the deployment in the UI and click the **Quick Run** button!\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf your worker does not appear in the Prefect UI, check the following:\n\n* Ensure that the ECS service is running and that the task definition is registered correctly.\n* Check the ECS service logs in CloudWatch to see if there are any errors.\n* Verify that the IAM roles have the correct permissions.\n* Ensure that the `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` environment variables are set correctly in the task definition.\n* For self-hosted Prefect servers, ensure that you replaced `PREFECT_API_KEY` from the example with `PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING` in the task definition.\n* Ensure your Prefect ECS worker has network connectivity to the Prefect API. If you are using a private VPC, ensure that there is a NAT gateway or internet gateway configured to allow outbound traffic to the Prefect API.\n\n### Event monitoring issues\n\nIf flow runs are not updating their status properly, check the event monitoring setup:\n\n* Verify the SQS queue was created and is receiving messages from EventBridge\n* Check that the EventBridge rule is active and properly configured for your ECS cluster\n* Ensure the worker task role has the necessary SQS permissions (`sqs:ReceiveMessage`, `sqs:DeleteMessage`, etc.)\n* Verify the `PREFECT_INTEGRATIONS_AWS_ECS_OBSERVER_SQS_QUEUE_NAME` environment variable is set correctly in the worker task definition\n* Check CloudWatch logs for any SQS-related errors in the worker logs\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you are confident your ECS worker is healthy, you can experiment with different work pool configurations.\n\n* Do your flow runs require higher `CPU`?\n* Would an EC2 `Launch Type` speed up your flow run execution?\n\nThese infrastructure configuration values can be set on your ECS work pool or they can be overridden on the deployment level through [job\\_variables](/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/customize/) if desired.",
