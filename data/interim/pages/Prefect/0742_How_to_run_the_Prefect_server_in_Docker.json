  "content": "Run a containerized Prefect server instance with Docker.\n\nYou can use the official Prefect Docker image to run a server in a container.\n\nIf you're running a server in a Docker container, you need to:\n\n* Port forward the server to your local machine (e.g. `-p 4200:4200`)\n* Set the `--host` flag on the `prefect server start` command to `0.0.0.0`\n* Set the API server address, `PREFECT_API_URL`, to use Prefect within a container.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ndocker run -p 4200:4200 -d --rm prefecthq/prefect:3-latest -- prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (i.e. in the background) and the `--rm` flag removes the container once it is stopped.\n</Tip>\n\nAfter running this command, verify that your local `prefect` profile is configured to point at your containerized server.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect config view --show-secrets\n```\n\nOpen the dashboard in your browser:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect dashboard open\n```\n\nFor more information, see the Docker topic about [Networking using the host network](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-host/).\n\n## Further reading\n\n* [How to scale self-hosted Prefect](/v3/advanced/self-hosted)\n* [Server concepts](/v3/concepts/server)\n* [How to manage settings](/v3/how-to-guides/configuration/manage-settings)",
