  "content": "## Welcome!\n\n`prefect-slack` is a collection of prebuilt Prefect tasks that can be used to quickly construct Prefect flows.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nA Slack account with permissions to create a Slack app and install it in your workspace.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe following command will install a version of `prefect-slack` compatible with your installed version of `prefect`.\nIf you don't already have `prefect` installed, it will install the newest version of `prefect` as well.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\npip install \"prefect[slack]\"\n```\n\nUpgrade to the latest versions of `prefect` and `prefect-slack`:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\npip install -U \"prefect[slack]\"\n```\n\n### Slack setup\n\nTo use tasks in the package, create a Slack app and install it in your Slack workspace. You can create a Slack app by navigating to the [apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps) for your Slack account and selecting 'Create New App'.\n\nFor tasks that require a Bot user OAuth token, you can get a token for your app by navigating to your app's **OAuth & Permissions** page.\n\nFor tasks that require a Webhook URL, you can generate a new Webhook URL by navigating to you apps **Incoming Webhooks** page.\n\nSlack's [Basic app setup](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics) guide provides additional details on setting up a Slack app.\n\n### Write and run a flow\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```python sync theme={null}\n  import asyncio\n  from prefect import flow\n  from prefect.context import get_run_context\n  from prefect_slack import SlackCredentials\n  from prefect_slack.messages import send_chat_message\n\n  @flow\n  def example_send_message_flow():\n     context = get_run_context()\n\n     # Run other tasks or flows here\n\n     token = \"xoxb-your-bot-token-here\"\n     asyncio.run(\n          send_chat_message(\n              slack_credentials=SlackCredentials(token),\n              channel=\"#prefect\",\n              text=f\"Flow run {context.flow_run.name} completed :tada:\"\n          )\n      )\n\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n      example_send_message_flow()\n  ```\n\n  ```python async theme={null}\n  from prefect import flow\n  from prefect.context import get_run_context\n  from prefect_slack import SlackCredentials\n  from prefect_slack.messages import send_chat_message\n\n\n  @flow\n  async def example_send_message_flow():\n     context = get_run_context()\n\n     # Run other tasks or flows here\n\n     token = \"xoxb-your-bot-token-here\"\n     await send_chat_message(\n          slack_credentials=SlackCredentials(token),\n          channel=\"#prefect\",\n          text=f\"Flow run {context.flow_run.name} completed :tada:\"\n     )\n\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n      asyncio.run(example_send_message_flow())\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Resources\n\nRefer to the `prefect-slack` [SDK documentation](https://reference.prefect.io/prefect_slack/) to explore all the capabilities of the `prefect-slack` library.\n\nFor further assistance developing with Slack, consult the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/).",
