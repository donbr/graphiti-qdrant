We recommend using [just](https://just.systems/) to run these commands.\n\n<Note>\n  **Installing just**\n\n  To install just:\n\n  * **macOS**: `brew install just` or `cargo install just`\n  * **Linux**: `cargo install just` or check your package manager\n  * **Windows**: `scoop install just` or `cargo install just`\n\n  For more installation options, see the [just documentation](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).\n</Note>\n\n### Using just (recommended)\n\n1. Clone this repository.\n2. Run `just docs` to start the documentation server.\n\nYour docs should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### Manual setup\n\nIf you prefer not to use just, you can set up manually:\n\n1. Clone this repository.\n2. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.\n3. Run `cd docs` to navigate to the docs directory.\n4. Run `nvm use node` to use the correct Node.js version.\n5. Run `npm i -g mintlify` to install Mintlify.\n6. Run `mintlify dev` to start the development server.\n\nYour docs should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nSee the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/development) for more information on how to install Mintlify, build previews, and use Mintlify's features while writing docs.\n\n<Info>All documentation is written in `.mdx` files, which are Markdown files that can contain JavaScript and React components. </Info>\n\n## Contributing examples\n\nExamples are Python files that demonstrate Prefect concepts and patterns and how they work together with other tools to solve real-world problems. They live in the `examples/` directory and are used to automatically generate documentation pages.\n\n### Example structure\n\nEach example should be a standalone Python file with:\n\n1. **YAML frontmatter** (in Python comments) at the top with metadata:\n   ```python  theme={null}\n   # ---\n   # title: Your Example Title\n   # description: Brief description of what this example demonstrates\n   # icon: play  # Choose from available icons (play, database, globe, etc.)\n   # dependencies: [\"prefect\", \"pandas\", \"requests\"]  # Required packages\n   # cmd: [\"python\", \"path/to/your_example.py\"]  # How to run it\n   # keywords: [\"getting_started\", \"etl\", \"api\"]  # Keywords to help with search and filtering\n   # draft: false  # Set to true to hide from docs\n   # ---\n   ```\n\n2. **Explanatory comments** throughout the code which will be used to generate the body of the documentation page.\n\n3. **Runnable code** that works out of the box with the specified dependencies.\n\nSee the [hello world example](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/examples/hello_world.py) as a guide.\n\n### Adding an example\n\nTo add an example, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create your Python file in the `examples/` directory\n2. Follow the structure above with frontmatter and comments\n3. Test that your example runs successfully\n4. Run `just generate-examples` to update the documentation pages\n5. Review the generated documentation to ensure it renders correctly\n\nOnce it all looks good, commit your changes and open a pull request.\n\n## Considerations\n\nKeep in mind the following when writing documentation.\n\n### External references\n\nPrefect resources can be managed in several ways, including through the CLI, UI, Terraform, Helm, and API.\n\nWhen documenting a resource, consider including external references that describe how to manage the resource in other ways.\nSnippets are available to provide these references in a consistent format.\n\nFor example, the [Deployment documentation](/v3/deploy) includes a snippet for the Terraform provider:\n\n```javascript  theme={null}\nimport { TF } from \"/snippets/resource-management/terraform.mdx\"\nimport { deployments } from \"/snippets/resource-management/vars.mdx\"\n\n<TF name=\"deployments\" href={deployments.tf} />\n```\n\nFor more information on how to use snippets, see the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets).",
