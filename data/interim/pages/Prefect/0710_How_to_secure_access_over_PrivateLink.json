  "content": "Manage network access to Prefect Cloud accounts over PrivateLink.\n\nPrivateLink is an available upgrade to certain Enterprise plans.\\\n[PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) enables account administrators to restrict access to Prefect Cloud APIs and the UI at the network level, by routing all network traffic through AWS and GCP.\\\nTraffic between your network and Prefect Cloud is encrypted, and does not traverse the public internet.\n\nTo learn more, please contact your account manager or the Prefect team at [sales@prefect.io](mailto:sales@prefect.io).\n\nYour Prefect team will provide the service endpoint to register.\nProvide the following information for the registered endpoint so that Prefect can accept the connection:\n\n* AWS Account Number\n* AWS VPC IDs\n* Source Region for each VPC (for example, `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, etc.)\n* VPC Endpoint ID\n\nPrefect will match your pending connection to the information provided, and accept the connection once approved.\n\nOnce accepted, customers should enable \"Modify Private DNS\" to ensure the VPCs can resolve the Prefect service endpoint.\n\nWith Private DNS and the accepted connection, connectivity can be validated through curl:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ncurl -i https://api-internal.private.prefect.cloud/api/health\n```\n\nTo configure Prefect clients and workers to use the endpoint, `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_CLOUD_API_URL` should be set to the endpoint provided by Prefect.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=https://api-internal.private.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>\nprefect config set PREFECT_CLOUD_API_URL=https://api-internal.private.prefect.cloud/api\n```",
