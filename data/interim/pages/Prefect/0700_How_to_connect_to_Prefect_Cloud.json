  "content": "Configure a local execution environment to access Prefect Cloud.\n\nTo create flow runs in a local or remote execution environment, first connect with Prefect Cloud or a\nPrefect server as the backend API server.\n\nThis involves:\n\n* Configuring the execution environment with the location of the API.\n* Authenticating with the API, either by logging in or providing a valid API key (Prefect Cloud only).\n\n## Log into Prefect Cloud from a terminal\n\nConfigure a local execution environment to use Prefect Cloud as the API server for flow runs.\nYou will log in a to Prefect Cloud account from the local environment where you want to run a flow.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a new terminal session.\n2. [Install Prefect](/v3/get-started/install/) in the environment where you want to execute flow runs.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\npip install -U prefect\n```\n\n3. Use the `prefect cloud login` Prefect CLI command to log into Prefect Cloud from your environment.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud login\n```\n\nThe `prefect cloud login` command provides an interactive login experience.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud login\n```\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n? How would you like to authenticate? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]\n> Log in with a web browser\n    Paste an API key\nPaste your authentication key:\n? Which workspace would you like to use? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]\n> prefect/terry-prefect-workspace\n    g-gadflow/g-workspace\nAuthenticated with Prefect Cloud! Using workspace 'prefect/terry-prefect-workspace'.\n```\n\nYou can authenticate by manually pasting an [API key](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/manage-users/api-keys) or through a browser-based approval that auto-generates an API key with a 30-day expiration.\n\n### Change workspaces\n\nTo change which workspace to sync with, use the `prefect cloud workspace set`\nPrefect CLI command while logged in, passing the account handle and workspace name:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud workspace set --workspace \"prefect/my-workspace\"\n```\n\nIf you don't provide a workspace, you will need to select one.\n\n**Workspace Settings** also shows you the `prefect cloud workspace set` Prefect CLI\ncommand to sync a local execution environment with a given workspace.\n\nYou may also use the `prefect cloud login` command with the `--workspace` or `-w` option to set the current workspace.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud login --workspace \"prefect/my-workspace\"\n```\n\n## Manually configure Prefect API settings\n\nYou can manually configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to specify the Prefect Cloud API.\n\nFor Prefect Cloud, configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` settings to authenticate\nwith Prefect Cloud by using an account ID, workspace ID, and API key.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=\"https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspaces/[WORKSPACE-ID]\"\nprefect config set PREFECT_API_KEY=\"[API-KEY]\"\n```\n\n<Note>\n  **Find account ID and workspace ID in the browser**\n\n  When authenticated to your Prefect Cloud workspace in the browser, you can get the account ID and workspace ID for the `PREFECT_API_URL` string from the page URL.\n\n  For example, if you're on the dashboard page, the URL looks like this:\n\n  [https://app.prefect.cloud/account/\\[ACCOUNT-ID\\]/workspace/\\[WORKSPACE-ID\\]/dashboard](https://app.prefect.cloud/account/\\[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspace/\\[WORKSPACE-ID]/dashboard)\n</Note>\n\nThe example above configures `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` in the default profile.\n\nYou can use `prefect profile` CLI commands to create settings profiles for different configurations.\nFor example, you can configure a \"cloud\" profile to use the Prefect Cloud API URL and API key;\nand another \"local\" profile for local development using a local Prefect API server started with `prefect server start`.\nSee [Settings](/v3/develop/settings-and-profiles/) for details.\n\n<Note>\n  **Environment variables**\n\n  You can set `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` just like any other environment variable.\n  Setting these environment variables is a good way to connect to Prefect Cloud in a remote serverless environment.\n  See [Overriding defaults with environment variables](/v3/develop/settings-and-profiles/) for more information.\n</Note>\n\n## Install requirements in execution environments\n\nIn local and remote execution environments, such as VMs and containers, ensure that you've installed any flow\nrequirements or dependencies before creating a flow run.",
