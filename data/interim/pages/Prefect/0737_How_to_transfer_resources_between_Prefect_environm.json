  "content": "Migrate flows, deployments, work pools, and other resources between Prefect profiles\n\nThe `prefect transfer` command enables you to migrate resources between different Prefect environments, whether moving from development to production, from self-hosted to cloud, or between cloud workspaces.\n\nThe command accepts a `--from` and `--to` [profile](/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles#profiles), and transfers all resources from the source to the destination.\n\n<Info>\n  The transfer command is available in Prefect [3.4.14](/v3/release-notes/oss/version-3-4) and later.\n</Info>\n\n## Quick start\n\nTransfer all resources from a development environment to production:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect transfer --from local --to cloud\n```\n\nThe command will:\n\n1. Discover all resources in the source profile\n2. Transfer resources to the destination profile\n3. Report success, failures, and skipped resources\n\n## What gets transferred\n\nThe transfer command moves the following resources:\n\n* [Flows](/v3/concepts/flows) and [deployments](/v3/concepts/deployments)\n* [Work pools](/v3/concepts/work-pools) and [work queues](/v3/concepts/work-pools#work-queues)\n* [Blocks](/v3/concepts/blocks) and their associated schemas/types\n* [Variables](/v3/concepts/variables)\n* [Global concurrency limits](/v3/concepts/global-concurrency-limits)\n* [Automations](/v3/concepts/automations)\n\nResources are transferred in the correct order to preserve relationships between them.\n\n## Common transfer scenarios\n\n### Development to production\n\nTransfer resources between different environments:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect transfer --from dev-profile --to prod-profile\n```\n\n### Self-hosted to cloud migration\n\nMove from a self-hosted Prefect server to Prefect Cloud:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect transfer --from self-hosted-profile --to cloud-profile\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  When transferring to Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces, certain resource types may be skipped due to tier limitations.\n</Warning>\n\n### Workspace consolidation\n\nResources can be transferred between multiple workspaces. Resources that already exist in the destination will be skipped.\n\n## Resource handling\n\n### Work pools\n\nThe transfer command handles different work pool types according to the destination:\n\n* **Hybrid pools** (process, docker, kubernetes): Transfer to any destination (except Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces)\n* **Push pools**: Transfer only to Prefect Cloud destinations (except Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces)\n* **Managed pools**: Never transferred\n\n### Existing resources\n\nResources that already exist in the destination are skipped you can run it multiple times safely.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# First run\nprefect transfer --from dev --to prod\n# Output: 25 succeeded, 0 skipped\n\n# Second run (idempotent)\nprefect transfer --from dev --to prod\n# Output: 0 succeeded, 25 skipped\n```\n\n### Resource limits\n\nWhen transferring to Prefect Cloud workspaces, certain resources may be skipped based on tier limitations. The transfer command will provide clear messages explaining why resources were skipped.\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Resources not transferred\n\nCertain resources are not transferred between environments:\n\n* Flow run history and logs\n* Result artifacts and cached data\n* Cloud-specific infrastructure resources\n* Credentials and secrets (must be recreated in the destination)\n\n### Environment-specific configuration\n\nSome resources may require manual configuration after transfer to work correctly in the new environment, particularly those that reference external systems or credentials.\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Pre-transfer checklist\n\n1. **Verify profiles**: Ensure both source and destination profiles are correctly configured\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   prefect profile inspect source-profile\n   prefect profile inspect dest-profile\n   ```\n\n2. **Test connectivity**: Confirm you can connect to both environments\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   prefect --profile source-profile config view\n   prefect --profile dest-profile config view\n   ```\n\n3. **Check tier limitations**: Understand destination workspace capabilities\n   * Hobby tier: Managed pools only, 5 deployment limit\n   * Standard/Pro tier: Full resource support\n\n### Post-transfer validation\n\nAfter transferring resources:\n\n1. **Verify critical resources**:\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   prefect --profile dest-profile work-pool ls\n   prefect --profile dest-profile deployment ls\n   ```\n\n2. **Test a deployment**:\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   prefect --profile dest-profile deployment run my-deployment/my-flow\n   ```\n\n3. **Check automation status**:\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   prefect --profile dest-profile automation ls\n   ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common issues\n\n**Resources skipped as \"already exists\"**\n\n* This is expected when resources already exist in the destination\n* The transfer can be run multiple times safely\n\n**Resources skipped due to tier limitations**\n\n* Some resource types require specific Prefect Cloud tiers\n* Check your workspace tier and capabilities\n\n**Connection errors**\n\n* Verify both profiles are correctly configured\n* Check network connectivity and authentication\n\n### Debug mode\n\nFor detailed transfer information, enable debug logging:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nPREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG prefect transfer --from source --to dest\n```\n\n## See also\n\n* [Settings and profiles](/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles) for configuring source and destination profiles\n* [Work pools](/v3/concepts/work-pools) for understanding pool types\n* [Prefect Cloud pricing](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) for workspace capabilities",
