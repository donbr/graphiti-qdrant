  "content": "Manage network access to Prefect Cloud accounts with IP Allowlists.\n\nIP allowlisting is an available upgrade to certain Enterprise plans.\nIP allowlisting enables account administrators to restrict access to Prefect Cloud APIs and the UI at the network level.\nTo learn more, please contact your account manager or the Prefect team at [sales@prefect.io](mailto:sales@prefect.io).\n\nOnce the feature has been enabled for your team's Enterprise account, use the Prefect CLI to add an IP address to the allowlist:\n\n<Note>To help prevent accidental account lockouts, an update to an allowlist requires the requestor's current IP address to be on the list.</Note>\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud ip-allowlist add <your-ip-address> --description \"My home IP address\"\n```\n\nThe allowlist has a limit of 25 entries;\nhowever in addition to individual IP addresses, a range of IP addresses can be added as a single entry using CIDR notation:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud ip-allowlist add \"192.168.1.0/24\" -d \"A CIDR block containing 256 IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255\"\n```\n\nNext, enable the allowlist for your account to start enforcing the restrictions:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud ip-allowlist enable\n```\n\nIndividual entries can also be toggled on or off:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud ip-allowlist toggle <ip-address>\n```\n\nOnce turned on with at least one enabled IP entry, the allowlist will be enforced for all incoming requests to Prefect Cloud from the UI and API.\n\nFor other related commands, see the CLI help documentation with:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect cloud ip-allowlist --help\n```",
