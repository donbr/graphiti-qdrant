  "content": "Learn about the Prefect settings that add security to your self-hosted server.\n\nPrefect provides a number of [settings](/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles) that help secure a self-hosted Prefect server.\n\n## Basic Authentication\n\nSelf-hosted Prefect servers can be equipped with Basic Authentication through two settings:\n\n* **`server.api.auth_string=\"admin:pass\"`**: this setting should be set with an administrator / password combination, separated by a colon, on any process that hosts the Prefect webserver (for example `prefect server start`).\n* **`api.auth_string=\"admin:pass\"`**: this setting should be set with the same administrator / password combination as the server on any client process that needs to communicate with the Prefect API (for example, any process that runs a workflow).\n\nWith these settings, the UI will prompt for the full authentication string `\"admin:pass\"` (no quotes) upon first load. It is recommended to store this information in a secure way, such as a Kubernetes Secret or in a private `.env` file.\n\n<Warning>\n  **Note on API keys**\n\n  API keys are only used for [authenticating with Prefect Cloud](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/manage-users/api-keys).\n\n  If both `PREFECT_API_KEY` and `PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING` are set on the client, `PREFECT_API_KEY` will take precedence. If you plan to use a\n  self-hosted Prefect server, make sure `PREFECT_API_KEY` is not set in your active profile or as\n  an environment variable, otherwise authentication will fail (`HTTP 401 Unauthorized`).\n</Warning>\n\nExample `.env` file:\n\n```bash .env theme={null}\nPREFECT_SERVER_API_AUTH_STRING=\"admin:pass\"\nPREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING=\"admin:pass\"\n```\n\n## Host the UI behind a reverse proxy\n\nWhen using a reverse proxy (such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io)) to proxy traffic to a\nhosted Prefect UI instance, you must also configure the self-hosted Prefect server instance to connect to the API.\nThe [`ui.api_url`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#api_url) setting should be set to the external proxy URL.\n\nFor example, if your external URL is `https://prefect-server.example.com` then you can configure a `prefect.toml` file for your server like this:\n\n```toml prefect.toml theme={null}\n[ui]\napi_url = \"https://prefect-server.example.com/api\"\n```\n\nIf you do not set `ui.api_url`, then `api.url` will be used as a fallback.\n\n## CSRF protection settings\n\nIf using self-hosted Prefect server, you can configure CSRF protection settings.\n\n* [`server.api.csrf_protection_enabled`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-protection-enabled): activates CSRF protection on the server,\n  requiring valid CSRF tokens for applicable requests. Recommended for production to prevent CSRF attacks.\n  Defaults to `False`.\n* [`server.api.csrf_token_expiration`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-token-expiration): sets the expiration duration for server-issued CSRF tokens,\n  influencing how often tokens need to be refreshed. The default is 1 hour.\n* [`client.csrf_support_enabled`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-support-enabled): enables or disables CSRF token handling in the Prefect client.\n  When enabled, the client manages CSRF tokens for state-changing API requests. Defaults to `True`.\n\nBy default clients expect that CSRF protection is enabled on the server. If you are running a server without CSRF protection,\nyou can disable CSRF support in the client.\n\n## CORS settings\n\nIf using self-hosted Prefect server, you can configure CORS settings to control which origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests to your server.\n\n* [`server.api.cors_allowed_origins`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-origins): a list of origins that are allowed to make cross-origin requests.\n* [`server.api.cors_allowed_methods`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-methods): a list of HTTP methods that are allowed to be used during cross-origin requests.\n* [`server.api.cors_allowed_headers`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-headers): a list of headers that are allowed to be used during cross-origin requests.\n\n## Custom client headers\n\nThe [`client.custom_headers`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#custom-headers) setting allows you to configure custom HTTP headers that are included with every API request. This is particularly useful for authentication with proxies, CDNs, or security services that protect your Prefect server.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash Environment variable theme={null}\n  export PREFECT_CLIENT_CUSTOM_HEADERS='{\n    \"Proxy-Authorization\": \"Bearer your-proxy-token\",\n    \"X-Corporate-ID\": \"your-corp-identifier\"\n  }'\n  ```\n\n  ```bash CLI theme={null}\n  prefect config set PREFECT_CLIENT_CUSTOM_HEADERS='{\"Proxy-Authorization\": \"Bearer your-proxy-token\", \"X-Corporate-ID\": \"your-corp-ID\"}'\n  ```\n\n  ```toml prefect.toml theme={null}\n  [client]\n  custom_headers = '''{\n    \"Proxy-Authorization\": \"Bearer your-proxy-token\",\n    \"X-Corporate-ID\": \"your-corp-identifier\"\n  }'''\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nCertain headers are protected and cannot be overridden for security reasons:\n\n* **`User-Agent`**: Managed by Prefect to identify client version and capabilities\n* **`Prefect-Csrf-Token`**: Used for CSRF protection when enabled\n* **`Prefect-Csrf-Client`**: Used for CSRF client identification\n\nIf you attempt to override these protected headers, Prefect will log a warning and ignore the custom value to maintain security.\n\n<Warning>\n  **Store credentials securely**\n\n  When using custom headers for authentication, ensure that sensitive values like API keys and tokens are stored securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or encrypted configuration files. Avoid hardcoding credentials in your source code.\n</Warning>",
