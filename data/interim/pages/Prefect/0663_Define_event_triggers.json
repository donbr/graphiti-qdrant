With custom triggers, you have access to the full capabilities of Prefect's automation system—allowing you to react to many kinds of events and metrics in your workspace.\n\nEach automation has a single trigger that, when fired, causes all of its associated actions to run. That single\ntrigger may be a reactive or proactive event trigger, a trigger monitoring the value of a metric, or a composite trigger\nthat combines several underlying triggers.\n\n<TF name=\"events\" href={events.tf} />\n\n<API name=\"events\" href={events.api} />\n\n### Event triggers\n\nEvent triggers are the most common type of trigger.

Each label added to a `match` filter\nis `AND`ed with the other labels, and can accept a single value or a list of multiple values that are `OR`ed together.\n\n#### Example\n\nSee the `resource` and `related` fields on the following `prefect.flow-run.Completed` event, truncated for this example.\nIts primary resource is a flow run, and since that flow run was started by a deployment, it is related to both its flow and its deployment:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"resource\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.925eacce-7fe5-4753-8f02-77f1511543db\",\n  \"prefect.resource.name\": \"cute-kittiwake\"\n}\n\"related\": [\n  {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow.cb6126db-d528-402f-b439-96637187a8ca\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\",\n    \"prefect.resource.name\": \"hello\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.deployment.37ca4a08-e2d9-4628-a310-cc15a323378e\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"deployment\",\n    \"prefect.resource.name\": \"example\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.work-pool.a67da06b-9427-4a0f-a709-c3b37ac29cbf\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"work-pool\",\n    \"prefect.resource.name\": \"k8s-pool\",\n    \"prefect.work-pool.type\": \"kubernetes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.tag.examples\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"tag\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThere are a number of valid ways to select the above event for evaluation, and the approach depends on the purpose of\nthe automation.\n\nThe following configuration filters for any events whose primary resource is a flow run, *and* that flow run has a\nname starting with `cute-` or `radical-`.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"match\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\",\n  \"prefect.resource.name\": [\"cute-*\", \"radical-*\"]\n},\n\"match_related\": {},\n...\n```\n\nBy comparison, this configuration filters for any events this specific deployment is a related\nresource to:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"match\": {},\n\"match_related\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.deployment.37ca4a08-e2d9-4628-a310-cc15a323378e\"\n},\n...\n```\n\nBoth of the above approaches will select the example `prefect.flow-run.Completed` event, but will permit additional,\npossibly undesired events through the filter as well. You can combine `match` and `match_related` for more restrictive\nfiltering:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"match\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\",\n  \"prefect.resource.name\": [\"cute-*\", \"radical-*\"]\n},\n\"match_related\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.deployment.37ca4a08-e2d9-4628-a310-cc15a323378e\"\n},\n...\n```\n\nNow this trigger will filter only for events whose primary resource is a flow run started by a specific deployment,\n*and* that flow run has a name starting with `cute-` or `radical-`.\n\n##### Advanced matching for related resources\n\n`match_related` also supports an array of objects, each of which can contain multiple labels.\nThis allows for more complex matching on related resources, such as filtering for events that are related to a specific work pool or tag.\n\nTo match flow runs on a work pool with specific tags, you can use the following configuration:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"match\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\",\n},\n\"match_related\": [\n    {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"k8s-pool\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"work-pool\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.tag.examples\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"tag\"\n    }\n]\n...\n```\n\n### Expected events\n\nOnce an event has passed through the `match` filters, you must decide if this event counts toward the\ntrigger's `threshold`. That is determined by the event names present in `expect`.\n\nThis configuration informs the trigger to evaluate *only* `prefect.flow-run.Completed` events that have passed the\n`match` filters.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"expect\": [\n  \"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"\n],\n...\n```\n\n`threshold` decides the quantity of `expect`ed events needed to satisfy the trigger. Increasing the `threshold`\nabove 1 requires use of `within` to define a range of time when multiple events are seen. The following\nconfiguration expects two occurrences of `prefect.flow-run.Completed` within 60 seconds:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"expect\": [\n  \"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"\n],\n\"threshold\": 2,\n\"within\": 60,\n...\n```\n\nUse `after` to handle scenarios that require more complex event reactivity.\n\nFor example, this flow emits an event indicating the table it operates on is missing or empty:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom prefect import flow\nfrom prefect.events import emit_event\nfrom myproject.db import Table\n\n\n@flow\ndef transform(table_name: str):\n  table = Table(table_name)\n\n  if not table.exists():\n    emit_event(\n        event=\"table-missing\",\n        resource={\"prefect.resource.id\": \"etl-events.transform\"}\n    )\n  elif table.is_empty():\n    emit_event(\n        event=\"table-empty\",\n        resource={\"prefect.resource.id\": \"etl-events.transform\"}\n    )\n  else:\n    # transform data\n    ...\n```\n\nThe following configuration uses `after` to prevent this automation from firing unless either a `table-missing` or a\n`table-empty` event has occurred before a flow run of this deployment completes.\n\n<Tip>\n  Note how `match` and `match_related` ensure the trigger only evaluates events that are relevant to its\n  purpose.\n</Tip>\n\n```json  theme={null}\n\"match\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": [\n    \"prefect.flow-run.*\",\n    \"etl-events.transform\"\n  ]\n},\n\"match_related\": {\n  \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.deployment.37ca4a08-e2d9-4628-a310-cc15a323378e\"\n}\n\"after\": [\n  \"table-missing\",\n  \"table-empty\"\n]\n\"expect\": [\n  \"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"\n],\n...\n```\n\n### Evaluation strategy\n\nAll of the previous examples were designed around a reactive `posture`; that is, count up events toward the\n`threshold` until it is met, then execute actions. To respond to the absence of events, use a proactive `posture`.\nA proactive trigger fires when its `threshold` has *not* been met by the end of the window of time defined by `within`.\nProactive triggers must have a `within` value of at least 10 seconds.\n\nThe following trigger fires if a `prefect.flow-run.Completed` event is not seen within 60 seconds after a\n`prefect.flow-run.Running` event is seen:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"match\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\"\n  },\n  \"match_related\": {},\n  \"after\": [\n    \"prefect.flow-run.Running\"\n  ],\n  \"expect\": [\n    \"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"\n  ],\n  \"for_each\": [],\n  \"posture\": \"Proactive\",\n  \"threshold\": 1,\n  \"within\": 60\n}\n```\n\nHowever, without `for_each`, a `prefect.flow-run.Completed` event from a *different* flow run than the one that\nstarted this trigger with its `prefect.flow-run.Running` event could satisfy the condition. Adding a `for_each` of\n`prefect.resource.id` causes this trigger to be evaluated separately for each flow run id associated with these events.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"match\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\"\n  },\n  \"match_related\": {},\n  \"after\": [\n    \"prefect.flow-run.Running\"\n  ],\n  \"expect\": [\n    \"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"\n  ],\n  \"for_each\": [\n    \"prefect.resource.id\"\n  ],\n  \"posture\": \"Proactive\",\n  \"threshold\": 1,\n  \"within\": 60\n}\n```\n\n### Metric triggers\n\nMetric triggers (`{\"type\": \"metric\"}`) fire when the value of a metric in your workspace crosses a threshold you defined.\nFor example, you can trigger an automation when the success rate of flows in your workspace drops below 95% over the course\nof an hour.\n\nPrefect's metrics are all derived by examining your workspace's events, and if applicable, use the `occurred` times of\nthose events as the basis for their calculations.\n\nPrefect defines three metrics:\n\n* **Successes** (`{\"name\": \"successes\"}`), defined as the number of flow runs that went `Pending` and then the latest\n  state we saw was not a failure (`Failed` or `Crashed`). This metric accounts for retries if the ultimate state was\n  successful.\n* **Duration** (`{\"name\": \"duration\"}`), defined as the *length of time* that a flow remains in a `Running` state before\n  transitioning to a terminal state such as `Completed`, `Failed`, or `Crashed`. Because this time is derived in terms of\n  flow run state change events, it may be greater than the runtime of your function.\n* **Lateness** (`{\"name\": \"lateness\"}`), defined as the *length of time* that a `Scheduled` flow remains in a `Late`\n  state before transitioning to a `Running` and/or `Crashed` state. Only flow runs that the system marks `Late` are included.\n\nThis is the schema of a metric trigger:\n\n| Name               | Type                      | Supports trailing wildcards | Description                                                    |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **match**          | object                    | ✅                           | Labels for resources which this Automation will match.         |\n| **match\\_related** | object OR array of object | ✅                           | Labels for related resources which this Automation will match. |\n| **metric**         | `MetricTriggerQuery`      | N/A                         | The definition of the metric query to run.                     |\n\nAnd the `MetricTriggerQuery` query is defined as:\n\n| Name            | Type                                  | Description                                                             |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **name**        | string                                | The name of the Prefect metric to evaluate (see above).                 |\n| **threshold**   | number                                | The threshold the current metric value is compared to.                  |\n| **operator**    | string (`\"<\"`, `\"<=\"`, `\">\"`, `\">=\"`) | The comparison operator to use to decide if the threshold value is met. |\n| **range**       | duration in seconds                   | How far back to evaluate the metric.                                    |\n| **firing\\_for** | duration in seconds                   | How long the value must exceed the threshold before this trigger fires. |\n\nFor example, to fire when flow runs tagged `production` in your workspace are failing at a rate of 10% or worse for the last hour (in other words, your success rate is below 90%), create this trigger:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"type\": \"metric\",\n  \"match\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\"\n  },\n  \"match_related\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.tag.production\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"tag\"\n  },\n  \"metric\": {\n    \"name\": \"successes\",\n    \"threshold\": 0.9,\n    \"operator\": \"<\",\n    \"range\": 3600,\n    \"firing_for\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo detect when the average lateness of your Kubernetes workloads (running on a work pool named `kubernetes`) in the\nlast day exceeds five minutes late—and that number hasn't gotten better for the last 10 minutes—use a trigger like this:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"type\": \"metric\",\n  \"match\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.flow-run.*\"\n  },\n  \"match_related\": {\n    \"prefect.resource.id\": \"prefect.work-pool.kubernetes\",\n    \"prefect.resource.role\": \"work-pool\"\n  },\n  \"metric\": {\n    \"name\": \"lateness\",\n    \"threshold\": 300,\n    \"operator\": \">\",\n    \"range\": 86400,\n    \"firing_for\": 600\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Composite triggers\n\nTo create a trigger from multiple kinds of events and metrics, use a `compound` or `sequence` trigger.\nThese higher-order triggers are composed from a set of underlying `event` and `metric` triggers.\n\nFor example, if you want to run a deployment only after three different flows in your workspace have written their\nresults to a remote filesystem, combine them with a 'compound' trigger:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"type\": \"compound\",\n  \"require\": \"all\",\n  \"within\": 3600,\n  \"triggers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n      \"match_related\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-customer-export\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n      \"match_related\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-revenue-export\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n      \"match_related\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-expenses-export\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis trigger fires once it sees at least one of each of the underlying event triggers fire within the time\nframe specified. Then the trigger resets its state and fires the next time these three events all happen.\nThe order the events occur doesn't matter, just that all of the events occur within one hour.\n\nIf you want a flow run to complete prior to starting to watch for those three events, you can combine the entire\nprevious trigger as the second part of a sequence of two triggers:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  // the outer trigger is now a \"sequence\" trigger\n  \"type\": \"sequence\",\n  \"within\": 7200,\n  \"triggers\": [\n    // with the first child trigger expecting a Completed event\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.flow-run.Completed\"],\n      \"match_related\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-export-initiator\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n      }\n    },\n    // and the second child trigger being the compound trigger from the prior example\n    {\n      \"type\": \"compound\",\n      \"require\": \"all\",\n      \"within\": 3600,\n      \"triggers\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"event\",\n          \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n          \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n          \"match_related\": {\n            \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-customer-export\",\n            \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"event\",\n          \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n          \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n          \"match_related\": {\n            \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-revenue-export\",\n            \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"event\",\n          \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n          \"expect\": [\"prefect.block.remote-file-system.write_path.called\"],\n          \"match_related\": {\n            \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-expenses-export\",\n            \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the trigger only fires if it sees the `daily-export-initiator` flow complete, and then the three\nfiles written by the other flows.\n\nThe `within` parameter for compound and sequence triggers restricts how close in time (in seconds) the child triggers\nmust fire to satisfy the composite trigger. For example, if the `daily-export-initiator` flow runs, but the other three\nflows don't write their result files until three hours later, this trigger won't fire. Placing these time constraints\non the triggers can prevent a misfire if you know that the events will generally happen within a specific timeframe—\nand you don't want a stray older event included in the evaluation of the trigger.\n\nIf this isn't a concern for you, you may omit the `within` period, in which case there is no limit to how far apart in time the child triggers occur.\n\nYou can compose any type of trigger into higher-order composite triggers, including proactive event triggers and metric\ntriggers. In the following example, the compound trigger fires if any of the following events occur: a flow run\nstuck in `Pending`, a work pool becoming unready, or the average amount of `Late` work in your workspace going over\n10 minutes:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"type\": \"compound\",\n  \"require\": \"any\",\n  \"triggers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Proactive\",\n      \"after\": [\"prefect.flow-run.Pending\"],\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.flow-run.Running\", \"prefect.flow-run.Crashed\"],\n      \"for_each\": [\"prefect.resource.id\"],\n      \"match_related\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"daily-customer-export\",\n        \"prefect.resource.role\": \"flow\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"event\",\n      \"posture\": \"Reactive\",\n      \"expect\": [\"prefect.work-pool.not-ready\"],\n      \"match\": {\n        \"prefect.resource.name\": \"kubernetes-workers\",\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"metric\",\n      \"metric\": {\n        \"name\": \"lateness\",\n        \"operator\": \">\",\n        \"threshold\": 600,\n        \"range\": 3600,\n        \"firing_for\": 300\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFor compound triggers, the `require` parameter may be `\"any\"`, `\"all\"`, or a number between 1 and the number of child\ntriggers. In the example above, if you feel that you are receiving too many spurious notifications for issues that\nresolve on their own, you can specify `{\"require\": 2}` to express that any **two** of the triggers must fire in order\nfor the compound trigger to fire. Sequence triggers, on the other hand, always require all of their child triggers to\nfire before they fire.\n\nCompound triggers are defined as:\n\n| Name         | Type                        | Description                                                             |\n| ------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **require**  | number, `\"any\"`, or `\"all\"` | The number of child triggers that must fire for this trigger to fire    |\n| **within**   | time, in seconds            | How close in time the child triggers must fire for this trigger to fire |\n| **triggers** | array of other triggers     |                                                                         |\n\nSequence triggers are defined as:\n\n| Name         | Type                    | Description                                                             |\n| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **within**   | time, in seconds        | How close in time the child triggers must fire for this trigger to fire |\n| **triggers** | array of other triggers |                                                                         |\n\n### Support for event trigger types\n\n| Feature                                  | Prefect Open Source | Prefect Cloud |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |\n| Event Triggers                           | ✅                   | ✅             |\n| Composite Triggers (Compound & Sequence) | ✅                   | ✅             |\n| Metric Triggers                          | ❌                   | ✅             |\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [How to create automations](/v3/how-to-guides/automations/creating-automations/)\n* [How to create webhooks](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/create-a-webhook/)",
