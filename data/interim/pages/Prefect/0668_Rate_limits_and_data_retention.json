  "content": "## API rate limits\n\n<Note>\n  **Rate limits are subject to change.**\n\n  Contact Prefect support at [help@prefect.io](mailto:help@prefect.io) with questions about rate limits.\n</Note>\n\nPrefect Cloud applies rate limits to API endpoints to ensure system stability. When limits are exceeded, endpoints return a `429` response with a `Retry-After` header.\n\n### Request limits by plan\n\nThe `flow_runs`, `task_runs`, and `flows` endpoints and their subroutes:\n\n* **Hobby**: 250 requests per minute\n* **Starter**: 500 requests per minute\n* **Team**: 1,000 requests per minute\n* **Pro**: 2,000 requests per minute\n* **Enterprise**: Custom limits\n\nThe `logs` endpoint:\n\n* **Hobby**: 500 logs per minute\n* **Starter**: 1,600 logs per minute\n* **Team**: 2,000 logs per minute\n* **Pro**: 10,000 logs per minute\n* **Enterprise**: Custom limits\n\nThe Prefect SDK automatically retries rate-limited requests up to 5 times, using the delay specified in the `Retry-After` header. You can customize this behavior through [client settings](/v3/develop/settings-ref#clientsettings).\n\n## Metadata retention\n\nPrefect Cloud retains flow run, task run, and artifact metadata for a limited time based on your plan. This applies to all workspaces in your account.\n\n### Retention periods by plan\n\n* **Hobby and Starter**: 7 days\n* **Team**: 14 days\n* **Pro**: 30 days\n* **Enterprise**: Custom retention periods\n\nMetadata is retained from creation until the specified period expires. For flow and task runs, retention is calculated from when the run reaches a [terminal state](/v3/develop/manage-states/#state-types). Subflow runs are retained independently from their parent flows.\n\nFor custom retention periods, [contact Prefect's sales team](https://www.prefect.io/pricing).",
