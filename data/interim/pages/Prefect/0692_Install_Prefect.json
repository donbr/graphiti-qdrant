  "content": "Prefect is published as a Python package, which requires Python 3.10 or newer. We recommend installing Prefect in a Python virtual environment.\n\nTo install Prefect, run:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash pip theme={null}\n  pip install -U prefect\n  ```\n\n  ```bash uv theme={null}\n  # add prefect to an existing virtual environment\n  uv pip install prefect\n\n  # add prefect to your pyproject.toml\n  uv add prefect\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nTo confirm that Prefect was installed successfully, run:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```bash pip theme={null}\n  prefect version\n  ```\n\n  ```bash uv theme={null}\n  uv run prefect version\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou should see output similar to:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nVersion:              3.4.24\nAPI version:          0.8.4\nPython version:       3.12.8\nGit commit:           2428894e\nBuilt:                Mon, Oct 13, 2025 07:16 PM\nOS/Arch:              darwin/arm64\nProfile:              local\nServer type:          server\nPydantic version:     2.11.7\nServer:\n  Database:           sqlite\n  SQLite version:     3.47.1\n```\n\n<Accordion title=\"More commands for power users\">\n  ### If you use `uv`\n\n  start an `ipython` shell with python 3.12 and `prefect` installed:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  uvx --python 3.12 --with prefect ipython\n  ```\n\n  install prefect into a `uv` virtual environment:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  uv venv --python 3.12\n  source .venv/bin/activate\n  uv add prefect\n  ```\n\n  add prefect to a project:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  uv add prefect\n  ```\n\n  run prefect server in an ephemeral python environment with `uvx`:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  uvx prefect server start\n  ```\n\n  ### If you use `docker`\n\n  run prefect server in a container port-forwarded to your local machine's 4200 port:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  docker run -d -p 4200:4200 prefecthq/prefect:3-latest -- prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0\n  ```\n</Accordion>\n\n## Windows installation\n\nYou can install and run Prefect via Windows PowerShell, the Windows Command Prompt, or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html). After installation, you may need to manually add the Python local packages `Scripts` folder to your `Path` environment variable.\n\nThe `Scripts` folder path looks something like:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nC:\\Users\\MyUserNameHere\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python311\\Scripts\n```\n\nReview the `pip install` output messages for the `Scripts` folder path on your system.\n\n## Minimal Prefect installation\n\nThe `prefect-client` library is a minimal installation of Prefect designed for interacting with Prefect Cloud or a remote self-hosted Prefect server instance.\n\n`prefect-client` enables a subset of Prefect's capabilities with a smaller installation size, making it ideal for use in lightweight, resource-constrained, or ephemeral environments.\nIt omits all CLI and server components found in the `prefect` library.\n\nTo install the latest release of `prefect-client`, run:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\npip install -U prefect-client\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou also need an API server, either:\n\n* [Prefect Cloud](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/connect-to-cloud/), a managed solution that provides strong scaling, performance, and security, or\n* [Self-hosted Prefect server](/v3/concepts/server/), an API server that you run on your own infrastructure where you are responsible for scaling and any authentication and authorization.\n\nNow that you have Prefect installed, go through the [quickstart](/v3/get-started/quickstart/) to try it out.\n\nSee the full history of [Prefect releases](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/releases) on GitHub.\n\nSee our [Contributing docs](/contribute/dev-contribute/) for instructions on installing Prefect for development.",
