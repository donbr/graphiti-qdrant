  "content": "Learn how to pause and resume deployment schedules using the Prefect CLI.\n\nYou can pause and resume deployment schedules individually or in bulk.\nThis can be useful for maintenance windows, migration scenarios, or organizational changes.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo manage deployment schedules, you need:\n\n* A Prefect server or [Prefect Cloud](/v3/get-started/quickstart) workspace\n* One or more [deployments](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments) with [schedules](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-schedules)\n* [Prefect installed](/v3/get-started/install)\n\n## Manage specific schedules\n\nTo pause or resume individual deployment schedules, you need the deployment name and schedule ID.\n\n### List schedules for a deployment\n\nFirst, list the schedules to get the schedule ID:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect deployment schedule ls my-flow/my-deployment\n```\n\n### Pause a specific schedule\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect deployment schedule pause my-flow/my-deployment <schedule-id>\n```\n\n### Resume a specific schedule\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect deployment schedule resume my-flow/my-deployment <schedule-id>\n```\n\n## Manage schedules in bulk\n\nWhen you have many deployments with active schedules, you can pause or resume all of them at once using the `--all` flag.\n\n### Pause all schedules\n\nUse the `--all` flag with the `pause` command to pause all active schedules across all deployments:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect deployment schedule pause --all\n```\n\nThis command pauses all active schedules across deployments in the current workspace. In interactive mode, you'll be asked to confirm.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nPaused schedule for deployment my-flow/daily-sync\nPaused schedule for deployment data-pipeline/hourly-update\nPaused schedule for deployment ml-model/weekly-training\nPaused 3 deployment schedule(s).\n```\n\n### Resume all schedules\n\nSimilarly, use the `--all` flag with the `resume` command to resume all paused schedules:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect deployment schedule resume --all\n```\n\nThis command resumes all paused schedules across deployments in the current workspace. In interactive mode, you'll be asked to confirm.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nResumed schedule for deployment my-flow/daily-sync\nResumed schedule for deployment data-pipeline/hourly-update\nResumed schedule for deployment ml-model/weekly-training\nResumed 3 deployment schedule(s).\n```\n\n### Skip confirmation prompt\n\nTo skip the interactive confirmation (useful for CI/CD pipelines or scripts), use the `--no-prompt` flag:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nprefect --no-prompt deployment schedule pause --all\nprefect --no-prompt deployment schedule resume --all\n```\n\n## Use cases\n\n### Maintenance windows\n\nPause all schedules during system maintenance:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Before maintenance\nprefect deployment schedule pause --all\n\n# Perform maintenance tasks...\n\n# After maintenance\nprefect deployment schedule resume --all\n```\n\n### Development environment management\n\nQuickly pause all schedules in a development environment:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Pause all dev schedules\nprefect --profile dev deployment schedule pause --all\n\n# Resume when ready\nprefect --profile dev deployment schedule resume --all\n```\n\n## Important notes\n\n<Warning>\n  **Use caution with bulk operations**\n\n  The `--all` flag affects all deployment schedules in your workspace.\n  In interactive mode, you'll be prompted to confirm the operation showing the exact number of schedules that will be affected.\n  Always verify you're in the correct workspace/profile before running bulk operations.\n</Warning>\n\n## See also\n\n* [Create schedules](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-schedules) - Learn how to create schedules for your deployments\n* [Run deployments](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/run-deployments) - Learn how to trigger deployment runs manually\n* [Deployment concepts](/v3/concepts/deployments) - Understand deployments and their schedules",
