To disable this, set `as_subflow=False`.\n</Note>\n\n### Async usage\n\nIn an async context, you can use the `run_deployment` function as a coroutine:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport asyncio\nfrom prefect.deployments import run_deployment\n\nasync def trigger_deployment():\n    flow_run = await run_deployment(\n        name=\"my-flow/my-deployment\",\n        parameters={\"my_param\": 42}\n    )\n    return flow_run\n\n# Run it\nflow_run = asyncio.run(trigger_deployment())\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Learn about [deployment schedules](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-schedules)\n* Explore [deployment triggers and automations](/v3/how-to-guides/automations/creating-deployment-triggers)\n* Understand [work pools and workers](/v3/concepts/work-pools)",
